<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1"></a></p>


<p>No less thoughtful a critic of men and manners
than Joseph Conrad has remarked recently that
a universal experience &quot;is exactly the sort of thing which
is most difficult to appraise justly in the individual instance.&quot;
The saying might have been made the motto
of this book, for in its pages Miss Colcord&mdash;with all the
eagerness of the newer school of social workers, bent
upon understanding, upon making allowances&mdash;seeks
that just appraisal to which Conrad refers. Marital
infelicities and broken homes are not universal, fortunately,
but some of the human weaknesses which lead
to them are very nearly so.</p>

<p>To one who brings a long perspective to any theme
in social work, Broken Homes suggests the successive
stages through which the art of social case work has
progressed. Twenty years ago the editor of this Series
was responsible for the following sentences in an annual
report: &quot;One of our most difficult problems has been
how to deal with deserted wives with children....
One good woman, whose husband had left her for the
second time more than a year ago, declared often and
emphatically that she would never let him come back.
We rescued her furniture from the landlord, found her
work, furnished needed relief, and befriended the children;<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>
but the drunken and lazy husband returned the
other day, and is sitting in the chairs we rescued, while
he warms his hands at the fire that we have kept burning.&quot;</p>

<p>The passage belongs to the first and what might be
termed the &quot;muddling along&quot; period of dealing with
family desertion, but the fact that boards of directors
actually were willing to print such frank statements
about their own shortcomings was a sign that the period
was drawing to a close.</p>

<p>This first stage was succeeded by a disciplinary period,
in which earnest attempts were made to enact laws that
would punish the deserter and aid in his extradition
whenever he took refuge across a state line. Laws of
the strictest, and these well enforced, seemed for a while
the only possible solution.</p>

<p>Then gradually, with the unfolding of a philosophy
and a technique of helping people in and through their
social relationships, a new way of dealing with this
ancient and perplexing human failing was developed.
This third way involved a more careful analysis of
relationships and motives, a greater variety in approach,
an increased flexibility in treatment, a new faith, perhaps,
in the re-creative powers latent in human nature.
But it is unnecessary to enlarge upon a point of view
which these pages admirably illustrate. Desertion laws
continue to serve a definite purpose, as Miss Colcord
makes clear, but no longer are they either the first or the
second resort of the skilful probation officer, family case
worker, or child protective agent.</p>

<p>Just after the Russell Sage Foundation published a<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>
treatise on Social Diagnosis two years ago, a number of
letters came to the author urging that a volume on the
treatment of social maladjustments in individual cases
follow. But this second subject is not yet ready for the
large general treatise. A topic so new as social case
treatment must be developed aspect by aspect, preferably
in small, practical volumes each written by a specialist.
This is such a volume, and Miss Colcord breaks
new ground, moreover, in that her book illustrates the
whole present trend of social work as applied to individuals.</p>

<p>Grateful acknowledgment should be made to the social
case workers who have furnished valuable contributions
to the body of data gathered for the present study.
Miss Colcord wishes mention made of her especial indebtedness

and Miss Elizabeth Wood of Philadelphia; Mr. C.C.
Carstens and Miss Elizabeth Holbrook of Boston;

and furnishing needed information.</p>

<p class="center"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>


<p>It has frequently been said that desertion is
the poor man's divorce but, like many epigrams,
this one hardly stands the test of experience.
When examined closely it is neither
illuminating nor, if the testimony of social case
workers can be accepted, is it true. It is true,
of course, that many of the causes of domestic
infelicity which lead to divorce among the well-to-do
may bring about desertion among the less
fortunate, but the deserting man does not, as a
rule, consider his absences from home as anything
so final and definite as divorce.</p>

<p>In a study of desertion made by the Philadelphia
Society for Organizing Charity in 1902,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> it
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>was found that 87 per cent of the men studied
had deserted more than once. The combined
experience of social workers goes to show that a
comparatively small number of first deserters
make so complete a break in their marital relations
that they are never heard from again, and
that an even smaller number actually start new
families elsewhere, although no statistical proof
of this last statement is available. One social
worker of experience says that in her judgment
desertion, instead of being a poor man's divorce,
comes nearer to being a poor man's vacation.</p>

<blockquote><p>A man who had always been a good husband and
father was discharged from hospital after a long and
exhausting illness and returned to his family&mdash;wife and
seven children&mdash;in their five-room tenement. Ten days
later he disappeared suddenly, but reappeared some two
weeks later in very much better health and ready to resume
his occupation and the care of his family. His
explanation of his apparent desertion was that he was
unable to stand the confusion of his home and &quot;had
needed rest.&quot; He had &quot;beaten his way&quot; to Philadelphia
and visited a friend there.</p></blockquote>

<p>The reporter of the foregoing remarks that it
illustrates &quot;unconscious self-therapy,&quot; and that
<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>the patient's disappearance might have been
avoided if the services of a good medical-social
department had been available at the hospital
where the man was treated.</p>

<p>It is more difficult to justify the thirst for
experience of another deserting husband who
came to the office of a family social agency
after an absence of a few months, with effusive
thanks for the care of his family and the explanation
that he &quot;had always wanted to see the
West, and this had been the only way he could
find of accomplishing it.&quot;</p>

<p>In fact, case work has convinced social workers
that there are few things less permanent
than desertion. In itself this provisional quality
tends to create irritation in the minds of many
of the profession. It is upsetting to plan for a
deserted family which stops being deserted, so
to speak, overnight. But in their understandable
despair social workers sometimes overlook
essential facts about the nature of marriage.
The <i>permanence</i> of family life is one of the foundation
stones of their professional faith; yet
they may fail to recognize certain manifestations
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>of this permanence as part and parcel of the end
for which they are striving. They would see no
point in the practice adopted by a certain social
agency which deals with many cases of family
desertion. This society, when it has had occasion
to print copies of a deserter's photograph
to use in seeking to discover his present whereabouts,
often presents his wife with an enlargement
of the picture suitable for framing. The
procedure displays, nevertheless, a profound insight
not only into human nature but into the
human institution called marriage.</p>

<p>In the next chapter will be considered some of
the causes that make men leave their homes.
To deal effectively with the situation created by
desertion, however, we have need of a wider
knowledge than this. Not only what takes men
away but what keeps them from going, what
brings them back, what leads to their being forgiven
and received into their homes again, are
matters that seriously concern the social case
worker. What is it that makes this plant called
marriage so tough of fiber and so difficult to
eradicate from even the most unfriendly soil?</p>

<p><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>It is fortunate (since the majority of case
workers are unmarried) that simply to have
been a member of a family gives one some understanding
of these questions. The theorist who
maintains that marriage is purely economic, or
that it is entirely a question of sex, has either
never belonged to a real family or has forgotten
some of the lessons he learned there.</p>

<p>Many volumes have been written upon the
history of marriage, or rather of the family,
since, as one historian justly puts it, &quot;marriage
has its source in the family rather than the
family in marriage.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In all these studies the
influence of law, of custom, of self-interest, and
of economic pressure, is shown to have molded
the institution of marriage into curious shapes
and forms, some grievous to be borne. But is
it not after all the crystallized and conventionalized
records of past time which have had to
be used as the source material of such studies,
and could the spiritual values of the family in
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>any period be found in its laws and learned discourses?
We might rather expect to find students
of these sources preoccupied with the outward
aspects, the failures, the unusual instances.
It is as true of human beings as of nations, that
the happy find no chronicler. &quot;Out of ...
interest and joy in caring for children in their
weakness and watching that weakness grow to
strength, family life came into being and has
persisted.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It is hardly conceivable that in
any society, however primitive, there were not
some real families&mdash;even when custom ran otherwise&mdash;in
which marriage meant love and kindness
and the mutual sharing of responsibilities.
And these families, today as always, are the creators
and preservers of the spiritual gains of the
human race. It has been beautifully said of the
family in such a form, that &quot;it is greater than
love itself, for it includes, ennobles, makes permanent,
all that is best in love. The pain of life is
hallowed by it, the drudgery sweetened, its pleas<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>ures
consecrated. It is the great trysting-place
of the generations, where past and future flash
into the reality of the present. It is the great
storehouse in which the hardly-earned treasures
of the past, the inheritance of spirit and character
from our ancestors, are guarded and preserved
for our descendants. And it is the great
discipline through which each generation learns
anew the lesson of citizenship that no man can
live for himself alone.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It follows that the
most trying and discouraging feature of social
work with deserted wives; namely, their determination
to take worthless men back and back
again for another trial, is often only a further
manifestation of the extraordinary viability of
the family.</p>

<p>It is true that, into this enduring quality, many
elements enter, some homely or merely material.
A desire for support, or for a resumption of
sex relations, may play a part in a wife's decision
to forgive the wanderer. There are many
other factors&mdash;use and wont; pride in being
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>able to show a good front to the neighbors; a
feeling that it is unnatural to be receiving support
from other sources. Just the mere desire
to have his clothes hanging on the wall and
the smell of his pipe about, the hundreds of
small details that go to make up the habit of
living together, have each their separate pull on
the woman whose instinct to be wife and mother
to her erring man is urging her to give in; Home
is, in both their minds,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot; ... the place where when you have to go there<br /></span>
<span>They have to take you in....<br /></span>
<span>Something you somehow haven't to deserve.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A woman who had left her home town and
found clerical work in a strange city, in order
not to be near her syphilitic husband from whom
she had determined to separate, said, &quot;When
you've been married to a man, you can't get
over feeling your place is with him.&quot;</p>

<p>However we may deplore the results in a
given case, the spineless woman who takes her
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>husband back many times may nevertheless be
giving a demonstration of the thing we are
most interested in conserving&mdash;the durability
and persistence of the family. And so the social
worker who is enabled by experience or imagination
to enter into the real meaning of family
life is neither scornful nor amused when Mrs.
Finnegan is found, on the morning when her
case against Finnegan is to come up in the
domestic relations court, busily washing and
ironing his other shirt in order that he may
make a proper appearance and not disgrace the
family before the judge.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>An attempt will be made in this small book
to analyze some causal factors in the problem of
the deserter, to touch upon recent changes in the
attitude of social workers toward deserted families,
to present illustrations from the best discoverable
practice in the treatment of desertion, and
to suggest certain possible next steps, both on the
legal and on the social side. For lack of space, it
will be impossible to consider the closely related
problems of the deserting wife, the unmarried
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>mother, or the divorced couple. It is assumed
throughout that the reader is familiar with the
general theory of modern case work; and no more
is here attempted than to give a number of suggestions
which will be found to be practical, it
is hoped, when the social worker deals with the
home marred and broken by desertion, or when
he seeks to prevent this evil by such constructive
measures as are now possible.</p>

<p class="center"><b>WHY DO MEN DESERT THEIR FAMILIES?</b></p>


<p>&quot;Before the deserter there was a broken
man,&quot; said a district secretary who has
had conspicuous success in dealing with such men.
By this characterization she meant not necessarily
a physical or mental wreck, but a man bankrupt
for the time being in health, hopes, prospects,
or in all three; a man who lacked the power or
the will to dominate adverse conditions, who had
allowed life to overcome him. Such an unfortunate
may not be conscious of his own share in
bringing about the difficulties in which he finds
himself, but he is always aware that something
has gone seriously wrong in his life. His grasp of
this fact is the one sure ground upon which the
social worker can meet him at the start.</p>

<p>We should distinguish between the <i>causes</i>
that bring about a given desertion, and the
<i>conscious motives in the mind of the deserter</i>. It
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>is well for the social worker to make the latter
the starting point in dealing with the man, accepting
the most preposterous as at least worthy
of discussion. The absconder is often too inarticulate
and ill at ease to give a clear picture
of what was in his mind when he went away.
If he was out of work, it may have been a perfectly
sincere belief that he would find work
elsewhere, or perhaps only a speculative hope
that he might. (These are not in the beginning
genuine desertions, but often become so later
on.) It is possible that, beset by irritations and
perplexities, the thought of cutting his way out
at one stroke from all his difficulties made an
appeal too strong to be resisted. Or perhaps
he flung out of the house and away, in a passion
of anger and jealousy which later crystallized
into cold dislike. The spell of an infatuation
for another woman might well have been the
cause; or he may have been mentally deranged
through alcohol. Simple weariness of the burden
which he has not strength of body or mind
to carry and ought never to have assumed is
one attitude to be reckoned with, and failure
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>to realize or in his heart accept the binding
nature of his obligations is another.</p>

<p>His temperamental instability may have been
such that the desire for a change&mdash;the &quot;wanderlust&quot;&mdash;was
driving him to distraction. Or
perhaps, under the urge of his own subconscious
feeling of failure, he may have convinced
himself that if he could &quot;shake&quot; the old environment
and all in it that hampered him, he could
take a fresh start and make good. &quot;If I could
only get to California,&quot; sighed Patrick Donald,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
&quot;I have a feeling things would be different.&quot;
With too much imagination to be content with
the situation in which he found himself, Donald
had not imagination enough to realize that he
would have to take his old self with him wherever
he went, and that he might better fight
things out where he stood. Men of his sort
yearn constantly for the future, not realizing
that in its truest sense the present <i>is</i> the future.</p>

<p>Only in rare instances will the deserter accept
the entire responsibility for his act. To try to
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>find justification for doing what we want to do
is characteristic of human beings, and the deserter
is no exception. He attempts to &quot;rationalize&quot;
his conduct and so regain his sense of
self-approval and well-being by finding excuses
and justifications in the conduct of others.
Even when the fault is all his, he usually succeeds
in making himself believe that his wife
is more to blame than he for his having left
home.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The social worker who attempts to
deal with the situation the deserter creates
should know this attitude in advance and be
prepared, through some simple rule-of-thumb
psychology, to attack the obsession and bring
him, first of all, to see and face squarely his
own responsibility.</p>

<p>Many blanket theories have been developed
to explain desertion&mdash;that it is due to economic
pressure; that it is the result of bad housekeeping;
that its causes can all be reduced to
sex incompatibility. All these factors: undoubt<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>edly
have their bearing on the problem, but
there is no one cause or group of causes underlying
breakdowns in family morale. The ratio
of desertions has been observed to decrease
rather than to increase in &quot;hard times&quot;;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> moreover,
it is a matter of common observation that
not all slovenly and incompetent wives are deserted,
and that many married couples in all
walks of life whose sex relationships are unsatisfactory,
nevertheless maintain the fabric of
family life and support and bring up their children
with an average degree of success. None
of these three factors alone will serve, therefore,
as a fundamental causation unit in desertion.
Many statistical attempts have been made to
study the causes of desertion, and to assign to
each its mathematical percentage of influence.
The report of a court of domestic relations gives
such an analysis of over 1,500 cases, listing 25
causes, and carefully calculating the percentage
of cases due to each. A summary of these
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>percentages grouped under five heads is as follows:</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='right'></td><td align='right'></td><td align='left'><i>Percentage</i></td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>1.</td><td align='left'>Distinct sex factors</td><td align='right'>39.03</td></tr>

</table></div>


<p>It would be easy to criticize the foregoing on
the score of grouping. Can alcoholism and drug
addiction be separated from mental and physical
disorders? And how distinguish infallibly between
sex factors, temperamental traits, and mental
disabilities? But the main defect in such
statistical studies is that they assume in each case
one cause, or at least one cause sufficiently dominant
to dwarf the rest; and few of the causes
listed are really fundamental. The mind instinctively
begins to reach back after the causes of all
these causes. The social worker who made the
sweeping assertion that there are two great reasons
for marital discord&mdash;&quot;selfishness in men and
peevishness in women,&quot;&mdash;came a good deal nearer
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>to an accurate statement of fact with infinitely
less trouble.</p>

<p>Looked at from the point of view of the social
worker, desertion is itself only a symptom of some
more deeply seated trouble in the family structure.
The problem presented, if it could have
been recognized in time, is not essentially different
from what it would have been before the
man's departure. Without attempting, therefore,
any statistical analysis of the causes of desertion,
we may nevertheless be able to examine one by
one a number of possible <i>contributory factors</i> in
marital unhappiness and therefore in desertion.
No attempt will be made in the list that follows
to distinguish between primary and secondary
causes, nor to arrange them in any order of
importance. An effort to get from case workers
lists so arranged resulted only in confusion, each
person emphasizing a different set of factors.
The groupings here given, therefore, are no more
than a placing of the more obviously related
factors together and a leading from past history
up to the present.</p>

<p>Considering first the personal as distinguished
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>from the community factors in desertion, these
may be listed as follows:</p>

<div><br /></div>
<p><b>CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS IN THE MAN AND WOMAN</b></p>

<p><b>1. Actual Mental Deficiency.</b>&mdash;Character weaknesses
such as were spoken of earlier in this
chapter grade down by degrees into real mental
defect or disorder, and not even the psychiatrist
can always draw the line.</p>

<p>A physician connected with the Municipal
Court in Boston gives as his opinion that while
the percentage of actually insane or feeble-minded
among deserters is no higher than among
other offenders they are extremely likely to
present some of the phenomena of psychopathic
personality. Such people have to be studied by
the social worker and the psychiatrist, and not
from the behavior side only, but with a view to
discovering what sort of equipment for life was
handed down to them from their family stock.</p>

<blockquote><p>The plan for the future of a fifteen-year-old boy which
was made by a society for family social work was markedly
modified when it was discovered that not only his
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>father but his grandfather had been a man of violent and
abusive temper, who drank habitually and neglected their
family obligations. With this sort of heredity and an
ineffective mother, whom he was accustomed to seeing
treated with abuse and disrespect, it was felt important
to remove the boy, who showed some promise, to surroundings
where he could be under firm discipline and
learn decent standards of family life.</p></blockquote>

<p>Feeble-mindedness, closely connected as it usually
is with industrial inefficiency in the man, bad
housekeeping in the woman, and lack of self-control
in both, is of course, a potent factor in
non-support and probably also in desertion.</p>

<p><b>2. Faults in Early Training.</b>&mdash;To low ideals of
home life and of personal obligation, which
were imbibed in youth, can be traced much
family irresponsibility. It is by no means the
rule, however, for children always to follow in
the footsteps of weak or vicious parents; and
it is the experience of social workers that such
children, taught by observation to avoid the
faults seen in their own homes, often make good
parents themselves. Perhaps even more insidious
in its effect on later marital history is
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>the home in which no self-control is learned.
The so-called &quot;good homes&quot; in which children
are exposed to petting, coddling, and overindulgence&mdash;and
these homes are not confined to the
wealthy&mdash;produce adults who do not stand up
to their responsibilities. A probation officer in
Philadelphia tells of the mother of a young
deserter who could not account for her son's
delinquency. &quot;He <i>ought</i> to be a good boy,&quot; she
complained; &quot;I carried him up to bed myself
every night till he was eleven years old.&quot;</p>

<p><b>3. Differences in Background.</b>&mdash;Even though both
man and wife come from good homes, if those
homes are widely different in standards and in
cultural background strains may develop in later
life between the couple. Differences in race, religion
and age are recognized as having a causative
relation to desertion. Miss Brandt<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> found
that, in about 28 per cent of the cases where
these facts were ascertained, the husband and
wife were of different nationality. &quot;In the
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>general population of the United States in 1900
only 8.5 per cent was of mixed parentage, and
for New York City the proportion was less than
13 per cent.... A difference in nationality
was more than twice as frequent among the
cases of desertion as among the general population
of the city where it is most common.&quot;
Miss Brandt's figures for difference of religion
are less significant, but it existed in 19 per cent
of the total number of cases for which information
on this point was available. In 27 per cent of
the families where age-facts were learned, there
were differences of over six years between the
two; in 15 per cent the woman was older than
the man.</p>

<p>Other differences which should find mention
under this heading are those that arise when
the environment is changed by immigration.
The man who precedes his wife by many years
in coming to America has often outgrown her
when she finally joins him, even if he has formed
no other family ties. The handicap is not
wholly overcome when the couple come to this
country together, for the much greater oppor<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>tunities
of the man to learn American ways may
drive a wedge between him and his wife. On
the other hand it is a popular saying, particularly
among young Italian immigrants, that girls who
have been in America too long do not make good
wives, that when a man wants to marry he had
better send for a girl from the old country; and
these marriages seem on the whole to turn out
well.</p>

<p><b>4. Wrong Basis of Marriage.</b>&mdash;Included here
should be hasty marriages, mercenary marriages,
marriages entered into unwillingly after pregnancy
had occurred, as well as marriages where
coercion was a factor for other reasons.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>When there have been sex relations before
marriage, unless the custom of the community
sanctions such intimacy, there are likely to develop
jealousies, quarrels, and ill feeling. &quot;He
do be always castin' it up at me, but sure, 'twas
himself was to blame&quot; is one version of the age-old
story.</p>

<p><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>There should also be included here those irregular
unions called &quot;common law marriages,&quot;
which are still permitted in many of our states.
The protection supposed to be afforded to the
woman by this institution is mainly fictitious, as
it is practically impossible to secure conviction
for bigamy if one of the marriages was of the
common law variety. A common law husband
who deserts, even if he admits his wife's legal
claim upon him, does not feel morally bound;
and this fact undoubtedly plays its part in the
causation of such desertions.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><b>5. Lack of Education.</b>&mdash;More is included under
this title than scanty &quot;book-learning.&quot; Not only
the morally undisciplined child but the mentally
undisciplined youth is handicapped as spouse and
parent. Ignorance of the physical and spiritual
bases of married life is a potent cause of desertion.
So also is a limited industrial equipment. Irregular
school attendance, early &quot;working papers,&quot;
a dead-end job with no educational possibilities
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>in it&mdash;these form a frequent background for later
unsuccess in life and in marriage.</p>

<blockquote><p>There seemed at first no good explanation for the
desertion of Alfred West. Both his record and his wife's
were good, and their mutual fondness for the children
seemed a strong bond. They constantly bickered, however,
over the small income Alfred was able to earn, and
his wife and her relatives &quot;looked down&quot; upon him as
being lower than they in the social scale. Inquiry into
past history showed that he had grown up in a southern
community where there were no facilities for education,
and that he could not even read and write until after his
marriage. Although of average capacity, he was restricted
by his early lack of training in his choice of a job;
and the mortification and sense of inferiority which his
wife fostered led to discouragement and indifference,
which ended in desertion. A thorough understanding of
the two backgrounds involved enabled a social worker to
effect a real reconciliation, with the woman's eyes opened
to her ungenerous behavior and the man taking steps to
improve his education in a night school.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>6. Occupational Faults.</b>&mdash;Closely allied to the
foregoing, and in some respects growing out of
it, are the shortcomings on the employment
side that contribute to marital instability. Most
of these can be referred back to lack of education
or opportunity in youth, or to defects of char<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>acter.
Laziness, incompetence, lack of skill in
any trade, lack of application, or, on the other
hand, the possession by a man with no business
&quot;stake&quot; in the community of a trade at which
he can work wherever he takes a fancy to go,
or of a trade which is seasonal and shifting&mdash;all
these have a direct relation to desertion.</p>

<p>The wife's competence and willingness to earn
often seems to have a causal connection with
the man's failure as &quot;provider.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Corresponding to and complementing the
man's industrial defects, and springing from the
same causes, is the woman's failure in the business
of being a housewife. The wife's laziness,
incompetence, lack of interest, and lack of skill
and knowledge create, as one case worker puts
it, &quot;the sort of home that tends to get itself
deserted.&quot; These faults of the wife are responsible
for as many desertions, probably, as are the
faults of the husband. When the man and the
wife are both industrial failures we get the
extremity of family breakdown to be found in
records of &quot;chronic non-support&quot; cases.</p>

<p><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><b>7. Wanderlust.</b>&mdash;As a cause of family desertion
this has probably been overestimated. Some
item of this sort appears in every list of causes
of desertion which has ever been compiled, and
there are more or less exceptional cases in which
it probably plays a part. The boy who becomes
a vagabond in childhood and early takes to the
road does not, however, seem to be a marrying
man; and the instances from case work in
which it is clear that the thirst for adventure
was at the bottom of desertion are rare. The
man whose line of work before marriage led
him from place to place seems, in fact, hardly
to contribute his quota to the ranks of wife-deserters,
and it is unusual to find sailors or
other wanderers from force of circumstance figuring
among them.</p>

<p><b>8. Money Troubles.</b>&mdash;As has already been said,
it is impossible to show any direct relation between
small incomes and desertion. The connection
between low wage and non-support is
of course a great deal closer. The inadequate
income unquestionably acts indirectly to break
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>down family morale in much the same way as
does lowered physical vitality.</p>

<p>But marital discord that springs from the
<i>handling</i> of the family finances is another matter,
and it recurs regularly in the history of
what went on prior to desertion. One deserter,
traced to a southern city, returned voluntarily
and begged the assistance of the social worker
interested to reform his wife's spending habits.
&quot;I made good money and I never opened my
pay envelope on her,&quot; said he, &quot;but the week's
wages was always gone by Thursday.&quot; Many
men, however, who make a boast of turning over
unbroken pay envelopes to their wives borrow
back so much in daily advances that their net
contribution is only a fraction of their wages.</p>

<p>Some desertions brought about by financial
difficulties are not, strictly speaking, marital
problems at all. Debts resulting from his own
extravagance or dishonesty may cause a man to
leave home to escape prosecution or disgrace.
One such man kept in touch with his family,
sending money at irregular intervals for some
years, but always moving on to another place
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>before he could be found. It proved impossible
to get in communication with him, and finally
he stopped writing and disappeared.</p>

<p><b>9. Ill Health: Physical Debility.</b>&mdash;All social workers
agree that physical condition plays a part,
though usually only indirectly and secondarily,
in causing desertion. In the man, it may lower
his vitality, cause irregular work, and superinduce
a condition of despondency and readiness
to give in. In the woman, it brings about careless
housekeeping, loss of attractiveness, and disinclination
to marital intercourse&mdash;all factors
which contribute directly to desertion. Continued
ill health of the wife brings burdens,
financial and other, which may help through
discouragement to break down the husband's
morale.</p>

<p>There should be included here some consideration
of one of the most puzzling types of
abandonment&mdash;the &quot;pregnancy desertion.&quot; Attempts
have been made to explain it on the
ground of the instinctive aversion of the male
sex for domestic crises. But the impulse that
<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>causes the prosperous householder to move to
his club when house-cleaning time arrives will
hardly serve to explain such a custom, and as a
matter of fact other domestic crises, such as
illnesses of the children, do not have any such
effect upon the man who habitually absents
himself from home before the birth of each
child. Other possible reasons for it are the
well-known irritability and &quot;difficulty&quot; of women
in this condition, and their aversion to sexual
intercourse. Some pregnancy deserters take
the step in the hope that their wives will bring
about an abortion; but this is a modern and
sophisticated development and the institution of
&quot;pregnancy desertion&quot; is one of undoubted
antiquity. Its prevalence among certain European
immigrants would almost point to its
being a racial tradition. Ethnologists who have
studied strange marriage customs, such as the
&quot;couvade,&quot; ought to turn their attention to
discovering the causes of this other and socially
more important marital vagary.</p>

<p><b>10. Temperamental Incompatibility.</b>&mdash;It is diffi<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>cult
to catalogue and appraise the causal factors
in desertion that lie in personality. They are
closely related to differences in background and
are intimately involved with the sex relations of
the pair. We cannot, however, admit that they
are identical with the latter, as some students
of the subject claim; or that the only incompatibility
in marriage is sex incompatibility.
Indeed, two people may be so incompatible as
to find in sex their only common ground.</p>

<p>The commonest of these temperamental differences
center about standards of right and
wrong or proper and improper conduct. Especially
is this manifested in the bringing up of
the children. Extreme self-righteousness on the
part of one or the other, nagging and petty
criticism, unreasonable jealousy, &quot;sulking spells,&quot;
violent quarrels, are some of its manifestations.
The idea of <i>possession</i> exercised by either of the
couple, and especially a tendency to dominate
or try to control on the part of the woman, may
be a causal factor in desertion. The lack of a
saving sense of humor in one or both is often
a complicating factor. These comparatively
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>minor differences take on a serious complexion
in the minds of the couple; and it is surprising
how often a deserting man will give promptly
and with every appearance of feeling justified
some cause for his desertion which falls clearly
under this head. &quot;People forgive each other
the big things; it's the little things they can't
forgive.&quot;</p>


<p><b>11. Sex Incompatibility.</b>&mdash;There comes under
this heading a wide range of causative factors
which play an important part in marital discord.
Some of them are better understood by
the social worker than was formerly the case;
but many of them are obscure even to the practitioner
of mental medicine, to whom their results
come daily. Distasteful as the task may
be, the social worker should familiarize herself,
through reading or through instruction by a
qualified physician, in the commoner forms of
these maladjustments. This is not urged because
it is part of the social worker's task to
make detailed inquiry into such matters or to
pass judgment upon them, but because they
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>often clamor for attention and need to be recognized
by the first responsible person to whose
notice they are brought. Unless she knows,
for instance, what constitutes excess in sex relations,
a worker may misunderstand the situation
described to her and condemn a man for
being a selfish brute, when the trouble is really
sexual an&aelig;sthesia in the wife. It is well known
that this single cause operates disastrously to
disrupt many marriages or else to render them
insupportable. The warning should be added,
however&mdash;and it cannot be added too emphatically&mdash;that
the social worker must scrupulously
refrain from making diagnoses in these cases,
even tentatively; she must refer such data as
come to her either to the general practitioner
or to the psychiatrist, selecting one or the other
as the symptoms presented may indicate.</p>

<p>Less well understood by the lay worker are
actual maladjustments, both physical and mental
(or spiritual), which prevent the complete
satisfaction of one or both. Some of these are
curable by medical care, others by instruction
and education. This instruction should be
<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>given, needless to say, by the physician and not
by the case worker. If uncorrected such maladjustments
are apt to result in marital shipwreck.</p>

<p>No attempt can be made here to discuss actual
sex perversions in their relation to desertion.
Their effect is obvious; and the social worker
should be sufficiently well informed, not only
from a few standard books on the subject,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
but from a knowledge of the phrases which are
used in the tenements, to understand them, so
that significant symptoms are not overlooked.
So intimately are sex difficulties connected with
the neuroses that the lay social worker should
consult the psychiatrist freely wherever one is
available, before attempting to deal with them.</p>


<p><b>12. Vicious Habits.</b>&mdash;Sexual immorality, through
its degenerative effect on personality and the
lowered ideals of marriage it induces, has a real
effect in bringing about desertion. The &quot;other
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>man&quot; and the &quot;other woman&quot; type of desertion,
however, is often itself only a consequence
of a previously existing state of temperamental
or sexual incompatibility. If these underlying
causes can be attacked and changed such a desertion
may be &quot;repairable.&quot;</p>

<blockquote><p>A young man deserted his wife and three children and
eloped with an eighteen-year-old girl who had made his
acquaintance in a street car flirtation. He had been &quot;an
obedient boy with good principles,&quot; and his later record
showed steadiness and ability; but he and his wife had
been drifting apart&mdash;their marital relations had not been
&quot;quite the same&quot; as formerly. Arrested and brought
back, he did not impute any blame to her, however, but
said he &quot;must have been crazy.&quot; In spite of the circumstances,
the judge decided to give him six months in the
penitentiary; and a man visitor from the family social
agency interested began at once to try to secure an
influence over him. On his release the couple again went
to housekeeping. The wife had been cautioned on how to
receive him; but things went badly at first, and the man
began again insisting that they were mismated. (He
&quot;had the other girl still considerably on his conscience
and heart.&quot;) Tangles continually arose which the
society's visitor was hard put to it to straighten out. Once
the wife found a letter from the girl; but finally, after the
charity organization society in the city where he had
left the girl reported that she was doing well and not
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>breaking her heart about him, the man decided to &quot;cut
out&quot; the correspondence. A little later the girl eliminated
herself by marrying. A year after the reconciliation the
wife told the friendly visitor that the trouble was gone
between them, and &quot;it was just like a new life.&quot; For
another year efforts were continued to strengthen the
attachment and make the home more attractive, at the
end of which time it was felt that the home was stable
enough to need no further supervision.</p></blockquote>

<p>For reasons of convenience we may include
here the causal relations between venereal disease
and desertion. In so far as syphilis brings
about mental and physical deterioration, the
relation between the two is obvious. The presence
of the disease in the man, if known to his
wife, may lead her to sever relations with him
in self-protection, and this severance, in turn,
may lead ultimately to desertion or complete
separation. Often separation is desirable, but the
syphilitic who is on the whole a good family man
raises some of the most difficult questions with
which the social worker has to deal. Whether
to try to force him out of the home and thus
make an unwilling deserter; whether to violate
the diagnosis given in confidence by passing it
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>on to the wife for her protection&mdash;these are only
two of the puzzles that may arise.</p>

<p>The relation of alcoholism to non-support and
desertion is too well known to require discussion.
The causative relation between alcohol and desertion
is so direct that it probably ought not
to be included under contributory causes at all.
As it is an active poison to the cells of the nervous
system, it may bring about deteriorations
of mind and character that are directly to blame
for such anti-social acts as desertion. The same
is true in less degree of the use of narcotics;
though drug habits are far less common in connection
with desertion than alcoholism. What
relation drugs and alcohol will hold to desertion
after July 1, 1919, remains to be seen.
Alcoholism in the woman is, however, a real
contributory factor, and one frequently met
with. The experience of social workers leads
them to believe that alcohol is more devastating
in its effects on character with women than with
men, and that there is less hope of a cure. The
great majority of so-called &quot;justifiable deserters&quot;
are the husbands of alcoholic women.</p>

<p><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>Gambling in its effect on family income will
be discussed in connection with non-support, to
which it bears a much more direct relation than
to desertion. In its degenerative effect upon
character it may have, however, a real causal
relation to the latter.</p>

<p>The habit of desertion itself is a degenerative
one, not only upon the deserter but upon his
home. The &quot;intermittent husband&quot; often
weakens and demoralizes his wife in almost the
same ratio as his own progress down-hill.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<p><b>CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS IN THE COMMUNITY</b></p>

<p><b>1. Interference of Relatives.</b>&mdash;The tendency of
relatives to take sides against their &quot;in-laws&quot;
is a matter of everyone's observation. It is
frequently found as a serious factor in desertion.
Many case stories which will be used in the following
chapters to illustrate other points show
also the harmful interference of relatives in what
might otherwise have been a fairly stable home.
Relatives can be a factor in marital discord
without actively interfering. One high-tempered
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>young couple formed what amounted to a habit
of frequent quarrels and temporary separations
simply because the parents of both stood ready
to take them back whenever they chose to live
apart. Relatives within the home as well as
outside it may exercise an unfortunate influence
on marital relations. The desertion of a middle-aged
man who married a widow was found to be
directly caused by the antagonism which grew
up between him and his grown step-children.</p>


<p><b>2. Racial Attitude toward Marriage.</b>&mdash;The racial
factor is important in desertion. Not only the
individual's own background, but the attitude
of the people whence he sprang toward the sanctity
of marriage, toward the position of women,
and toward the importance of restraint in sexual
relations, will have an effect upon the desertion
rate of a given racial group. A study was recently
made of 480 deserters known to the New
York Charity Organization Society in 1916-17
whose nationality was given. The results in
percentage form are given for what they may be
worth, compared with the same percentage in<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>
2,987 families of known nationalities which were
under care for all causes during the same year.</p>

</table></div>


<p><b>3. Community Standards.</b>&mdash;It cannot be too
emphatically stated that any tendency in the
community to belittle or ridicule the estate of
matrimony has a definite cumulative effect on
desertion. The &quot;when a man's married&quot; series
in the comic supplements, certain comic films
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>in the moving picture shows, the form of drama
popularly called &quot;bedroom farce&quot; are examples
of these destructive forces. Most of the people
who laugh at them accept them as a humorous
formula and are not seriously affected by them;
but their educational effect on young people is
bound to be bad and false to the last degree.
In so far as they overemphasize romantic love
and disparage conjugal love, the theater and the
popular press do this generation great disservice.</p>

<p>Another way in which the community may
affect the popular conception of marriage is in
the administration of civil marriage. Lack of
care in enforcing the laws and lack of gravity
in performing the ceremonies may have a decided
reaction on respect for those laws and for
the institution itself. Similarly, the administration
of divorce laws may affect the popular
conception of marriage. One entire neighborhood
condoned the situation in which a deserted
wife immediately went to live with another man,
on the ground that &quot;if they had been rich, they
could have got a divorce.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><b>4. Lack of Proper Recreation.</b>&mdash;This may seem a
subject to be discussed under personal factors;
but proper recreation, after all, depends in large
measure upon what the community provides or
makes available. The American tendency for the
man to get his recreation apart from his family,
in saloons and social clubs, is responsible for
many family maladjustments. Any change in
family habits of recreation which means that
the man and wife enjoy fewer things together is
a danger signal the seriousness of which is not
always appreciated. Social workers are inclined
to undervalue not only the influence of faulty
recreation as a factor in family breakdown, but
also the possibilities of good recreation as an
aid in family reconstruction.</p>


<p><b>5. Influence of Companions.</b>&mdash;As a factor in desertion
this is closely connected with the two
just discussed. Neighborhood standards, as
they affect individuals, are apt to be transmitted
through the small group that stands
nearest, and a man's companions have the freest
opportunity to influence him during their com<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>mon
periods of recreation. The influence of
companions is not often met as a force deliberately
exerted to bring about desertion; but, on
the other hand, a man's own mental contrast
between his condition and that of his unmarried
companions often plays a definite part in
his decision to desert, if he has begun to yearn
for freedom. The influence of companions is
particularly connected with the &quot;wanderlust&quot;
type of desertion.</p>


<p><b>6. Expectation of Charitable Relief.</b>&mdash;It used to
be held that many men who would otherwise
remain at home and support, might be encouraged
to desert if they had reason to believe
that their wives and families would be cared
for in their absence. This was no doubt often
the case before social workers had learned to
discriminate in treatment between deserted
wives and widows, or to press with vigor the
search for deserting men. At present, it is the
experience of social workers that few men deliberately
reckon upon transferring the burden
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>of their family's support to others, or are induced
by these considerations to leave.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In trying to determine the cause for any given
desertion it is well to keep in mind from the beginning
that there is probably more than one,
and that the obvious causes that first appear are
almost certain themselves to be the effects of
more deeply underlying causes. A young vaudeville
actor of Italian parentage married a Jewish
girl, a cabaret singer, and took her home to
live with his parents. Was his subsequent desertion
to be ascribed to difference in nationality
and religion, to interference of relatives, to
irregular and unsettling occupation, or to a
combination of all three? Would all marriages
so handicapped turn out as badly? If not, what
further factors entered to lower the threshold of
resistance to disintegration in this particular case?</p>

<p>This last question is after all the most important
one of the foregoing series. It is one
which the social case worker must never be
content to leave unanswered.</p>

<p class="center"><b>CHANGES OF EMPHASIS IN TREATMENT</b></p>


<p>Unconsciously and imperceptibly, the
point of view about the treatment of desertion
has been changing during the past fifteen
years. The case worker's attention used to be
focussed on the danger of increasing the desertion
rate by a policy of too sympathetic care
for deserters' families. Little study was made
of individual causes, and in so far as there was
a general policy of treatment it was to insist,
wherever a desertion law existed, that the deserted
wife go at once to court and institute
proceedings against her husband. He was often
not seen by the social worker until he appeared
in court. The policy toward the family meantime
was to reduce its size by commitment of
the children until their mother could support
herself unaided; or, if relief was given, to give
smaller amounts than to a widow or the wife
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>of a man in hospital. As soon as the man had
been placed under court order or had returned
home, old records generally show that the social
worker's efforts were relaxed, and often the final
entry is, &quot;Case closed&mdash;family self-supporting.&quot;</p>

<p>There were excellent reasons underlying much
of the practice. Few laws were at that time in
existence or at all adequately enforced, and any
man who desired was at liberty, so far as the
community was concerned, to walk off and leave
his family at any time. The multiplicity of
sources of relief in the large communities and
the absence of anything resembling investigation
constituted almost an invitation to men to
desert. It did not occur to the charitable public
to draw any line between the widow and the
deserted wife, or indeed to inquire which of
these two a woman was, so long as she was a
good mother and &quot;seemed worthy.&quot; No wonder
that the pioneering social agencies, busy
forging tools out of the very ore, took a rigid
stand on such a question of social policy as this.
Although their deterrents failed to eradicate the
evil of desertion or indeed to touch its sources,
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>there is little doubt that they did lessen its
volume by creating a wholesome respect for the
power of the law in the mind of the would-be
deserter and by fostering in his wife a disposition
to stand up for her rights. The more
lenient and more constructive policies now in
force have been made possible in part by these
changes of attitude. The very fact that the
collusive desertion, once fairly common, is now
seldom met with, illustrates the salutary effects
of the earlier methods of treatment.</p>

<p>But the fact remains that no marked change
has been seen in the desertion rate, that successive
desertions have not been prevented in
individual cases. Hardly any statistical figure
in the work of family social agencies shows so
little fluctuation from year to year and between
different cities, as the percentage of deserted
families. It generally forms from ten to fifteen
per cent of the work of any such society.</p>

<p>Gradually, therefore, the repressive features
of the earlier treatment have been abandoned,
and there has come about a realization of the
complexity of causes that bring about family
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>breakdowns. In particular, the relation of sex
maladjustments to failure in marriage have received
the serious attention of the social worker.
On the question of court intervention there has
been almost a right-about face; the best social
practitioners now say, unhesitatingly and unequivocally,
that they take cases into court only
as a matter of last resort, after case work methods
have been tried and have failed. In no other
case where court action is undertaken by one
individual against another does the relation between
them remain unchanged. One could not
conceive of a business partnership failing to be
annulled by one partner who brought suit
against another; yet we expect the marriage
relation to survive this. As a matter of fact,
such is its vitality that it often does. But many
times the result of court action is only to deaden
once and for all the tiny spark from which
marital happiness might have been rekindled.
As long as it survives, both man and wife feel
in their inmost hearts that, no matter what his
offense, to &quot;take him to court&quot; is treason against
the intangible bonds that still hold between
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>them. No matter how far apart they have
drifted, or how unforgivable has been the deserter's
offense, something irrevocable does happen
to the fabric of marriage, a few poor shreds
of which may still exist between the two, when
his wife appears in a court of law to make complaint
against him. It is an instinctive realization
that she is abandoning hope which underlies
many a woman's reluctance to &quot;take a
stand against her husband.&quot; Many social workers
(including some probation officers and court
workers) now feel that such a stand should be
urged only in the full conviction that the protection
of the woman and children demands it,
and that there is nothing else to be done.</p>

<p>This must not, however, be interpreted as a
criticism of the laws concerning desertion or of
the courts which administer them. If they
were not there in the background, ready to be
taken advantage of when all else fails, the social
worker's hands would be tied, and the possibility
of a rich and flexible treatment of desertion
problems would be lost to her. It is precisely
because they had no such recourse that the case
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>workers of an earlier day had to adopt a policy
which now seems rigid. It is because they were
instrumental in securing better laws and specialized
courts that the latter day social worker
can push forward her own technique of dealing
with homes that are disintegrating.</p>

<p>Another great change in emphasis has been
upon the question of interviewing the man, and
of being sure that his side, or what he thinks is
his side, has been thoroughly understood. Social
workers are under conviction of sin in the matter
of dealing too exclusively with the woman of
the family; in desertion cases it is more than
desirable, it is vitally necessary to have dealings
with the man. Many social workers feel
that, at all events with a first desertion, they
would rather take the risk of having the man
vanish a second time after having been found,
than have him arrested before an attempt to
talk the matter out with him. More stringent
measures, they believe, can be resorted to later&mdash;but
the man must first be convinced that he
will be listened to patiently and with the intent
to deal fairly. The case worker knows that the
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>power of the human mind to &quot;rationalize&quot;
anti-social conduct is infinite; and that, besides
the few &quot;justifiable deserters,&quot; there are many
who have succeeded in convincing themselves
that their action is warrantable. A deserter who
could allege nothing else against his wife, averred
that he had placed under the bed two matches,
crossed, and a week later found them in the
same position, proving his contention that she
was slovenly and did not keep the rooms clean.</p>

<p>The man who, aided by a sore conscience,
has worked himself into such a state of mind
as this must be permitted to talk himself out
before he can be made to see the true state of
affairs. In the minds of both man and woman
there is likely to be found a superstructure of
suspicion, jealousy, misinterpretation and distrust,
built upon the basic fact of their incompatibility,
which has to be pulled down before
the true causes can be probed. To arrest a man
in this state of mind is in his eyes simply to
&quot;take sides&quot; against him. Eventually he may
have to be arrested, but, in the case worker's
experience, the chances of success are ten to
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>one if the man can be induced to take some
voluntary step toward reconciliation without
the intervention of the law. In many instances
a real interview with the man, while not exonerating
him, would have thrown new light on the
woman's statements.</p>

<blockquote><p>A family social work society writes: A young woman
with her mother and little boy were referred for aid by
a medical social department because her husband had
deserted and she was unable to work. The doctors
feared that her breakdown would result in insanity, so
they asked that her wishes be respected in not seeing the
man's family. She recovered, but it was later found
that her husband, while not doing all that he might for
her, had been living at home a good deal of the time and
did not know that his family was in receipt of aid.</p>

<p>Some years ago a charity organization society, which
maintained a special bureau for treatment of desertion
cases, was asked by a Mrs. Clara Williams to help her
find her husband, John, who had left her some years
previously and was living with another woman, so that
she might force him to contribute to the support of herself
and her two children. Mrs. Williams was a motherly
appearing person who kept a clean, neat home, and
seemed to take excellent care of her children. She was
voluble concerning her husband's misdeeds and very
bitter toward him, which seemed only natural. The fact
of the other household was corroborated from other
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>sources, and Mr. Williams' work references indicated that
he had been quarrelsome and difficult for his employers
to get along with, although a competent workman. The
problem seemed to the desertion agent a perfectly clear
and uncomplicated one and he proceeded to handle it
according to the formula. Some very clever detective
work followed, in the course of which the man was traced
from one suburban city to another, and his present place
of employment found in the city where his wife lived,
although he lived just across the border of another state.
The warrant was served upon the man as he stepped from
the train on his way to work, and he appeared in the
domestic relations court. He did not deny the desertion
but made some attempt to bring counter charges against
his wife. When questioned about his present mode of
living he became silent and refused to testify further.
He was placed under bond, which was furnished by the
relatives of the woman with whom he was living, to pay
his wife $6.00 a week. No probation was thought necessary
and the case was closed, both the court and the
charity organization society crediting themselves with a
case successfully handled and terminated.</p>

<p>About a year later Mrs. Williams again applied, stating
that her husband's bond had lapsed, his payment had
ceased, and that she had no knowledge of his whereabouts.
Although her home and children were still immaculate
she failed to satisfy the social worker who this time
visited her home with the plausible story which she had
told before. The children's health was not good and
they seemed unnaturally repressed and unhappy. Ugly
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>reports that Mrs. Williams drank came to the society.
The school teacher deplored the effect which the
morbid nature of Mrs. Williams was having on her
youngest child&mdash;a daughter just entering adolescence.
The son, a boy a little older, was listless and unsatisfactory
at his work, and defiant and secretive toward any
attempt to get to know him better. He spent many
nights away from home and was evidently not on good
terms with his mother. As soon as Mrs. Williams saw
that real information was desired she began indulging in
fits of rage in which she displayed such an exaggerated
ego as to cause some doubts as to her mentality. Baffled
at every turn the case worker decided to interview the
man, if possible, to see if through him any clue to the
situation might be gained. The first step was to gain
the confidence of a former fellow-workman and friend of
his who now maintained his own small shop. This was
done after several visits, the deserting husband consenting
to an evening meeting in his friend's shop.</p>

<p>A most illuminating interview followed. Mr. Williams
was found to be an intelligent though melancholy and
self-centered man. The couple had married somewhat
late in life, it being Mrs. Williams' second marriage.
She had been strongly influenced by her mother to
marry him and had never had any real affection for
him. It became very evident from his story that the
strongly developed egotism of both the husband and
wife had made a real marriage impossible between them,
and the visitor became convinced of the genuineness of
Mr. Williams' protestations that he endured the constant
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>abuse and ill-treatment of his wife as long as it had been
possible to do so. As her drinking habits took more hold
upon her and he had realized that the break was coming
he had endeavored to place the children in homes, and
had once had his wife taken into court. There her
plausible story and good appearance resulted in the case
being dismissed with a reprimand to the husband. He
then left home, but continued to send her money at intervals,
although as he got older he was able to earn less at
his trade. Socialism was his religion, and it was his
preaching of this doctrine in season and out to his fellow
workmen which had earned him the ill-will of his employers.
He defended his present mode of living, vigorously
putting up a strong argument that it was a real marriage,
whereas the other had only been a sham. He spoke in
terms of affection of the woman who was giving him the
only real home he had ever known, and only wished that
the state of public opinion would permit his taking his
young daughter into his home. The boy, he realized, had
grown entirely away from him and they could never mean
anything to each other. It was his habit to make frequent
trips back to the region where his family lived in
order that he might stand on the corner and watch his
children go by. He gave readily much information about
his own and his wife's past connections, including the
addresses of many of her relatives whose existence she had
denied, and he successfully proved that her claims as to
his lapsed payments were false by producing the entire
series of post office receipts covering his remittances to
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>her and extending down to the very week of the interview.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There have been striking changes not only in
the treatment of the deserter but in that of his
family. Writing in 1910, Miss Breed<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> deprecates
the habit of fostering the deserter's &quot;easy-going
conviction that his family will get along somehow
without him&quot; by giving relief. She approves
offering full support in an institution,
but is reluctant to recommend any form of aid
in the home, even from relatives. It is better,
she feels, to give entire support to some of the
children in foster homes, leaving the mother
only those she can care for.</p>

<p>Much can be said for even so stringent a
policy as this. An unstable home, with a worthless
father an intermittent member of the household,
is as bad an environment as children can
have&mdash;its very fluctuations making for nervous
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>instability and a wrong point of view later on.
There is a possibility that other would-be deserters
may be deterred by temporarily breaking
up the home, and that an occasional absconding
father may be brought back. But the fact remains
that social workers have, in practice, departed
far from this point of view. Out of more
than twenty-five case workers of experience who
were interviewed or written to in preparation for
this book, only one believed there had not been
a decided change toward a policy of more liberal
relief.</p>

<blockquote><p>One district secretary told of a woman who had more
than once taken back a disreputable husband whom she
always professed to dislike. Aid was given sparingly and
intermittently during his absences; but finally the
woman in a burst of frankness told the secretary that she
had never felt confident the society would stand behind
her. Each time the man came back with money in his
hand, she cheated herself into believing that he meant
&quot;a new leaf.&quot; A budget was worked out with her, and a
promise given of an adequate income as long as she kept
her husband away. She has faithfully kept her side of
the bargain for over three years.</p></blockquote>

<p>The extension in many states of &quot;state aid to
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>mothers&quot; to cover deserted wives is an indication
of this changed view. In most states, however,
some safeguards are set up; the wife must
take out a warrant, and a given number of years
must elapse during which the man shall not
have been heard from, before state aid can be
granted to the wife.</p>

<p>Finally, it is more clearly recognized than
formerly that the time to &quot;close the case&quot; is
not just after the man's return.</p>

<blockquote><p>A case supervisor speaks of &quot;the strong temptation to
close our records as soon as relief becomes unnecessary.
The man's return to the family is often the critical point
at which there is need of skilful and sympathetic friendship.
These cases cry out for continued treatment. We
need to think more humanely about all the unsettling
elements in our urban civilization and to see that all the
nice individual adjustments that as case workers we can
make are made. If the man's work gives him no opportunity
for self-expression, what attempt are we making to
give him such opportunities outside his work, to connect
him with a trade union, with clubs and with fraternities?
How much are we thinking about cures for inebriates,
psychoanalysis, vocational guidance, recreation?&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>Briefly, then, changes in the social worker's
attitude toward treatment have meant less
<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>emphasis on punitive and repressive measures,
more consideration of the man's point of view,
less tendency to press court action, at least in
the beginning, fewer commitments of children,
a more liberal relief policy (partly as a preventive
of &quot;forced reconciliations&quot;), and lastly,
longer supervision after the man has resumed
support of his family.</p>

<p class="center"><b>FINDING THE DESERTING HUSBAND</b></p>


<p>A few years ago a young Jewish woman reported
to the National Desertion Bureau<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
that her husband had left her and their children.</p>

<blockquote><p>The couple had never got on well, and the man seemed
to have been a melancholy and impractical fellow. The
usual methods of the Bureau brought no results in finding
the missing husband. Then the wife was more carefully
questioned, and urged to tell all that she could recall or
had heard about her husband's early life, his tastes and
peculiarities. Among other things the Bureau learned
that the man's father had died in America years ago, having
come here to make a home for the family left behind
in Russia. The boy had grown up in ignorance of the
place of his father's death and burial, and, as the eldest
son, he felt it his duty to find his father's grave. Filled
with this idea he came to America as soon as he was
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>grown and landed in New York, but his few poor clues
availed him little against the difficulties of poverty and a
new and complex environment. In the end he gave up
the search, married, and settled down on the east side.
After the sudden quarrel which led to his leaving home,
his wife thought it possible that his old obsession might
have reawakened. The Bureau, supplied with the clues
in question, had little difficulty in discovering the father's
burial place in St. Louis; and the cemetery authorities
promised to send word if the missing husband should
appear. Sure enough, a short time afterward he arrived,
and, after visiting the grave, returned, not unwillingly,
and took up his family duties again under the supervision
of a probation officer.</p></blockquote>

<p>The flexibility of method and the readiness to
see and utilize new resources which are displayed
in the foregoing account are great assets
to the one who must institute search for a missing
husband and father.</p>

<p>The thing that sets desertion cases apart in a
class of peculiar technical difficulty for the case
worker is not simply that the man is away
from his family. There is no man to deal with
in a widow's family, but widows' families present
comparatively simple problems. The deserter,
though absent, is still not only a potential but
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>also a real factor in the family situation. The
plans of the family are often made with one eye
to his return; he is the unseen but plainly felt
obstacle to much that the social worker wants
to accomplish. The children look forward to
his reappearance with dread or with joy (for
many deserters have a way with them, decidedly,
and are welcome visitors to their children). In
short, he is usually at the key point in the situation.
No plan can safely be made that leaves
him out, but&mdash;there's the rub!&mdash;you cannot include
him at once for he is not to be reached,
certainly not at the outset. The discovery of
the deserter's whereabouts is not only the first
but the most urgent of the problems that confront
the worker who tries to deal with a deserted
family. Unless he can be found the whole
plan rests upon shifting sand.</p>

<p>A prompt and vigorous effort to find the
absentee is therefore a first requisite in dealing
with family desertion. Unfortunately, many
case workers, having started bravely and exhausted
the first crop of clues, become discouraged
and fall back on the supposition that the
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>man is permanently out of the scene, and that
it only remains to make plans for the family.
Numberless case histories attest the unwisdom
of this assumption. It is not making an extreme
statement to say that, as long as the family
remains under active care or until the missing
man is proved to be dead, the effort to find him
should not be abandoned. Mr. Carstens, in
discussing this point, says:</p>

<blockquote><p>To carry on this search persistently is the great safeguard.
It is rare when in the course of a few months the
true state of affairs will not have been revealed, though it
may have been quite hidden at the start.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This is not to say that time must be spent
unprofitably in going over the same ground, or
that out-of-town agencies must be badgered to
reinvestigate old clues. But the frame of mind
that pigeonholes the whole matter as having
been attended to must be shunned by the social
worker, who should be always on the alert for
new clues and prompt to follow them up. An
example of a vigorous and persistent search for
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>a deserter is taken from the files of the National
Desertion Bureau.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Adolph R. deserted his wife and their six little children
on September 1, 1912. He was traced to Philadelphia,
but had left there the day before the tidings reached New
York. Information was obtained from fellow-employes
which led to the belief that he had gone to Tampa,
Florida. Inquiry was directed to the rabbi in that city,
but again the information was disheartening, since it disclosed
the fact that once more R. had &quot;left the day
before.&quot; The rabbi telegraphed that the deserter had
evidently gone to Lakewood, Florida, and that he could
be found in that place. Immediately the Bureau dispatched
a telegram to its representative there, only to
find that R. had merely passed through Lakewood en
route to Bartow, Florida. When the inquiry reached
Bartow it was learned that R. had left a few days before,
and that he was on his way to Memphis, Tennessee. The
Jewish Charities of Memphis made investigation at the
cigar factories of that city, but reported that no person
bearing the name of R. or resembling him had been seen
in their city. No further clue to his whereabouts could
be secured.</p>

<p>Months later R. applied to the Jewish Charities of
Louisville for transportation to New York, making an
entirely false statement about his family.</p>

<p>This statement was telegraphed to the Bureau and no
time was lost in securing a warrant. Louisville was noti<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>fied
by wire to arrest, but again a telegram came: &quot;Adolph
R. left city. Learned from Cigarmakers' Union headquarters
he went to Cincinnati. Wire Joe Rapp, 1316
Walnut Street, Cincinnati Union Headquarters. Man
said he was going to Cincinnati or Indianapolis. Man
joined union Richmond, Va., November 19, 1911, and
reports to union in all cities.&quot; The Desertion Bureau
immediately telegraphed to Cincinnati and Indianapolis.
The United Jewish Charities of Cincinnati working together
with the labor union lost little time in effecting his
arrest.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many theories about family desertion have
suffered a change in recent years. One of these
relates to the &quot;collusive desertion.&quot; Social
workers in training used formerly to be taught
that the first place to look for the deserter
was around the corner, where he could slip
back into the house and partake of charitable
bounty or, at the very least, keep close watch
of his family and return if any serious danger
threatened them. Although the collusive desertion
seems to have been a frequent happening in
the past, there is almost unanimous testimony
from case workers at the present time that it
is not common. &quot;I don't come across an instance
once a year,&quot; said one case worker.<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></p>

<blockquote><p>Another, after searching her memory, recalled what
seemed to her one instance of real collusion. A woman,
pregnant and seeming to be in great destitution, applied
to a family social work society in a small city for help.
Careful search did not discover the man's whereabouts&mdash;he
seemed to have disappeared without leaving a trace,
and his wife professed ignorance. Some two weeks after
this the visitor, calling late, met a man on the stairs who
proved to be the missing husband. Times were hard and
he was out of a job, so he had taken to the attic of their
house, and had kept so strictly <i>incommunicado</i> that not
only the society but the neighbors had been deceived.</p></blockquote>

<p>Out of twenty or more case workers in different
cities whose experience was sought on
this point, nearly all felt that the warnings
against possible collusion which used to be given
to young workers no longer needed to be emphasized.
Testimony in the other direction is,
however, advanced by the National Desertion
Bureau, which found that about 10 per cent of
the applications made in 1910 to the United
Hebrew Charities of New York for relief because
of desertion were collusive.</p>

<p>It should be said, however, that one form of
collusion is common to the experience of case
workers&mdash;that of the wife who knows where her
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>husband is, or has a very good idea, but does
not want him to return and so keeps her knowledge
to herself. &quot;In two of our regular allowance
families,&quot; writes the case supervisor of a
family agency, &quot;we discovered&mdash;one quite incidentally,
one after the allowance had been discontinued
for other reasons&mdash;that the wife had
had reports regarding the man which we might
have followed up had we known of them earlier.
It could hardly be called collusion&mdash;it was mere
indifference.&quot; A probation officer writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;At the present time we have under investigation a
family where the man has been away from home for two
years and his whereabouts during the last year have been
known to his wife. He has been living in a suburb of the
city and working steadily during that time. The woman
has received adequate aid from public and private organizations.
She has been content to accept that rather than
notify the authorities and have her husband required to
meet the responsibility. The man on his part was aware
that his family was being supported, and while there was
no agreement between the parties regarding it, nevertheless
the arrangement apparently met with mutual
approval.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>To guard against this and similar omissions
on the woman's part, more than one agency
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>which deals with family desertion requires the
deserted wife to sign an affidavit that she has
given all the information she possesses.</p>

<p>Although in practice the possibility of a collusive
desertion is not the first and most important
thing to keep in mind, it is frequent
enough not to be entirely forgotten. And for
yet other reasons it is well to keep a watchful
eye upon the neighborhood in which the family
is living for reports about the man. Often obscure
impulses seem to bring him back; jealousy
of the wife or a desire to show himself in a
spirit of bravado, or even sometimes a fugitive
affection for the children he has abandoned may
cause him to appear in the neighborhood. &quot;The
deserter, like the murderer, harks back to the
scene of his misdeeds&quot; was the generalization of
one district secretary.</p>

<p>Even when he does not appear in the flesh
the deserter may seek news of his family. &quot;One
deserter was found through the Attendance
Department [of the public school system] to
which he wrote after a three years' absence ask<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>ing
the address of one of the children of whom
he was especially fond.&quot;</p>

<p>There is little in the literature of the subject
covering methods of discovering deserters, nor
do case workers generally appear to have developed
a special technique. The decided reaction
against detective methods which has been apparent
in the profession during later years may
help to explain this fact. Most social workers
feel a subconscious sense of injustice in having
to do this work at all, since it is properly a
function of the police. Prosecutors and police
officials generally take very little interest in
following up deserters, and have little idea of
giving any treatment to the deserter who has
been found other than arraignment and conviction.
It is difficult for the probation officer or
the family case worker to hold up the machinery
of the law, once it has been started, and to do
this long enough to find out whether some other
form of treatment best suits the case. For
these reasons the social worker usually prefers
to do or else is forced to do the work of the
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>detective in desertion cases up to the point
where arrest is in his judgment necessary.</p>

<blockquote><p>A probation officer in D&mdash;&mdash; found that he could not
work through the local police in searching for a certain
deserter, because the missing man's political affiliations
made them friendly to him. The probation officer knew
in a general way that the man was likely to be in the city
of S&mdash;&mdash; in the same state, so he secured a warrant and
sent it with such slight clues as were at hand, to a probation
officer of that city who was successful in the
search. Avoiding the usual procedure, the warrant was
served by the police in S&mdash;&mdash;. &quot;Several instances of
this kind have occurred lately,&quot; writes the probation
officer at D&mdash;&mdash;.</p></blockquote>

<p>The necessity of doing the detective's work
raises at once the question of how far the social
worker can afford to adopt the detective's
methods. If reformation of the man is the end
sought it would seem an axiom that he must be
given from the first every reason to believe that
the social worker will play fair. &quot;We are very
careful never to break a promise we have made
to a man,&quot; says an agency which deals with
many deserters. The same agency, as illustration
of its own methods in seeking deserting
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>men, instances the case of a man who was being
shielded by his sister, but was discovered by an
officer who scraped acquaintance with her little
boy and asked innocently, &quot;Where's your uncle
Jack now?&quot; In another case the officer learned
of a man's whereabouts through his relatives by
representing himself as a lawyer's clerk calling
about a legacy which had been left the man.
In still another case, reported by a different
agency, a man who had deserted his family was
known to be receiving mail through the general
delivery of another city. It was ascertained that
he was writing to a woman in his home town.
A letter was sent to him in care of General
Delivery asking him to meet the writer (who was
represented to be the young woman with whom
he was corresponding). The wife was sent to
that city and she and the local probation officer
met the man and served the warrant.</p>

<p>There is, of course, something to be said in
favor of the use of such methods. The protection
of the weak and helpless may justify, in
certain circumstances, any subterfuge. But the
<i>detective</i> who arrests the criminal in ways like
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>these is seeking his punishment and nothing else.
There is no thought in that case of establishing
personal relations and effecting the long, slow
process of reformation. When social workers use
such methods it should be in the full realization
that they are foregoing any future advantage of
straight dealing with the man. To capture a
man by a trick is to declare war on him; and,
in his mind, the social worker and the policeman
then stand in the same place, &quot;I'd have
him there to meet you,&quot; said a deserter's chum
to a woman visitor, &quot;if I wasn't sure, in spite
of your straight talk, you'd have a bull waiting
behind a tree.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></p>

<p><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>If it is a first desertion, or if there is room for
doubt whether an accident may have befallen
the man, police and hospital records should be
looked up.</p>

<blockquote><p>A woman with four children applied to a charity
organization society, saying her husband had disappeared.
There was a rumor that someone had seen him fall off the
dock while intoxicated, but no attempt had been made to
confirm this and the family was treated as a deserted
family for some months, until the man's body was found
in the river and identified.</p></blockquote>

<p>If there have been previous desertions, it is
extremely important to secure their history.
The reasons that moved the man once are
likely to do so again, and he is apt to return
to his former haunts and be seen by former
friends and acquaintances.</p>

<p>The deserting man, unless he elopes with another
woman, generally goes to some cheap
lodging house or, if of foreign birth, he may
seek out the quarter where those of his nationality
reside and become a lodger in a family in
which his native tongue is spoken. Hence, a
canvass of the lodging houses&mdash;armed with a
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>photograph if possible&mdash;is a desirable first step.
All of the social worker's casual acquaintance
with the foreign quarters of his city comes into
play in the search. If the man is in the city
some &quot;landsmann,&quot; some &quot;paesano&quot; has seen
him, and knows where he is to be found. It
may even narrow down to finding the particular
house on the particular street where the immigrants
from a particular village in Sicily or
Galicia have their abode. The pool-rooms and
saloons of the district can often be made to
yield information, especially if a man visitor
can canvass them. In dealing in this way with
mere acquaintances of the man, it is usually not
necessary for the social worker to tell who he
himself is or to state the purpose of his inquiry.
In talking with relatives or close friends, however,
it is often best to lay all cards on the table
and convince one's listener first of all that the
man sought will have fair treatment and a
chance to state his side of the case before any
proceedings are begun against him.</p>

<p>Even a relative who has never been seen may
sometimes be induced to act effectively.<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></p>

<blockquote><p>A man who deserted his wife and family was reported
to have gone to his brother in another city. Nothing
definite was known of the brother except that he was a
telephone lineman. No address could be secured through
the company, but they agreed to forward a letter to this
relative. He never answered; shortly, however, the
deserter reappeared, having been persuaded to return
voluntarily by the brother to whom the letter had been
addressed.</p></blockquote>

<p>During the war local draft boards were of the
greatest assistance in finding deserting men.
Election records too have been of real value in
the case of men who were voters. Passports
and immigration records may in some instances
yield information helpful in establishing whereabouts.
Where there is actually a warrant out
for the man's arrest, the active co-operation of
the postal authorities can sometimes be secured
in furnishing return addresses on envelopes delivered
to persons with whom the culprit is
known to be in correspondence.</p>

<p>Problems of family desertion involving men
in service during the war were in the main
handled by the Red Cross Home Service. Before
the war, private case working agencies had
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>learned that the regular Army and the Navy
often seemed desirable havens to would-be
family deserters. The difficulties of finding
them there were great, owing to the fact that
they often enlisted as single men under an assumed
name. It has usually been possible to
gain excellent co-operation from the military
authorities if there are any clues whatever.</p>

<blockquote><p>The desertion bureau of a family social work society
learned that a deserting man had expressed a desire long
before he left his family to enlist in the Army. Several
letters were exchanged with the War Department, and
the man was finally found to be with a company serving in
the Canal Zone. As he had made misrepresentations
when he enlisted, the War Department was willing to
transfer him from Panama to a camp within the limits of
the city where the desertion had taken place and there
discharge him. This brought the absconder within the
jurisdiction of the local courts and made it possible to
arrest him as soon as he was outside the bounds of the
camp.</p></blockquote>

<p>It will repay the visitor to make not only a
careful study of the deserting man's employment
history but also to learn something about the
trade he follows. A cloakmaker, for instance,
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>who deserts in New York City is likely to be
found in Cleveland, for these are the two centers
of the cloak branch of the garment trade. Certain
seasonal occupations give the periodical deserter
a great opportunity. Among these are
hop picking, berry picking, and lumbering. The
amusement parks near the large cities also furnish
occupation for the seasonal deserter. The
case worker cannot be expected to have such
knowledge at his finger-tips, but he can go to
people who know about the fluctuations of particular
trades&mdash;to employers, union officials or
fellow-workmen who may throw light on a deserter's
movements. The story of Adolph R.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> is
an excellent illustration of the help that may be
obtained from trades unions and from fellow-workmen.
A family welfare bureau in a western
city writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;In one instance a blacksmith's union published the
picture of the deserting man in its official journal and
asked that information regarding him be sent to the local
unit here. This proved successful. In another instance
a union gave us access to its books and helped us to trace
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>all the men of a given name listed there. By this means
we found the man we were looking for. One man, a
vaudeville performer, we traced through the <i>Bill Board</i>
(a trade paper) by discovering the movements of the show
with which he had been connected.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>Another society succeeded in getting a certain
trade union to post a description and photograph
of a missing man on its bulletin boards.
This aided in finding the man. Fraternal orders
may be; used in the same way, though for many
reasons they cannot be so helpful as the trades
unions.</p>

<p>Employment agencies should not be forgotten
in seeking to trace a man through his industrial
record. The extension of the federal employment
service, with free inter-city communication,
should be of assistance in getting upon the
track of deserters.</p>

<p>The co-operation of newspapers can be secured
to good effect in tracing missing men.</p>

<blockquote><p>Herbert McCann, who had been doing railway construction
in Russia, returned to this country and disappeared
while en route from an eastern city to his home
in Canada. There was reason to think that he might
have left the train in an intoxicated condition at an
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>important junction point; and the family social agency of
that city was asked to trace him. No information was
secured from the police, lodging houses, employment
agencies, etc., and finally the following advertisement was
inserted in the local paper: &quot;<i>Information Wanted</i>&mdash;Anyone
knowing the whereabouts of Herbert McCann, Montreal,
who returned from Russia in June, will confer a
favor upon his family by notifying Social Service Building,
34 Grand Street.&quot; Six days later a reply was
received from a man in a nearby town, and McCann was
found at work in a factory there.</p></blockquote>

<p>More than upon any other method the National
Desertion Bureau depends on the publication
of pictures and short newspaper paragraphs.
As this Bureau deals entirely with
Jewish deserters, it works chiefly through the
Yiddish newspapers. Its &quot;Gallery of Missing
Husbands&quot; is a regular weekly feature in some
of the better known of these journals, and attracts
increasingly wide attention. The Bureau
estimates that 70 per cent of the deserters which
it finds are discovered through the publication
of pictures. It should be remembered, however,
that this Bureau is dealing with a selected
group, who know a great deal about one an<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>other,
live closely together, follow in the main
only a few trades, and read only a limited number
of foreign-language newspapers. Whether
anything like the same results could be obtained
by the same methods applied to deserting husbands
of many different national and social
backgrounds is open to question.</p>

<p>Since most deserters leave the city, if not the
state, the social worker who is dealing with the
family problem is often not the same person to
whom is delegated the task of finding the man.
This fact makes necessary the most careful and
sympathetic co-operation between the social
workers or agencies, which must work together
at long range upon the problem. In the case
of Herbert McCann, just cited, not less than
four family social work societies were concerned&mdash;three
in the United States and one in Canada.
This necessitated keeping in the closest touch,
by letter and telegram, so that each was informed
of the doings of the others. Such a
piece of work calls for a common body of experience
and technique among the workers concerned,
amounting almost to an unwritten under<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>standing
as to how the work should be done.
Nothing makes more fascinating reading than
the record of a quick, touch-and-go investigation,
such as is presented in the finding of a
deserter conducted by skilled case workers who
are accustomed to work together. Much can,
under these circumstances, be taken for granted
or left to the discretion of the worker or agency
whose help is being sought. There are instances,
however, where no such common understanding
exists, and where the home-town agency
has to work through people with little social
training or with training of a type which definitely
unfits them properly to approach the deserting
man. It is a distressing experience to
know that a man has slipped through one's
fingers, been frightened off or alienated, by
poor work at the other end. Are there any
ways to reduce the number of these mischances?</p>

<p>Even with the closest co-operation among case
workers of ability in different cities the results
are not always as favorable, for obvious reasons,
as if the person who knows the family were the
one to find and interview the man. More and
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>more it is realized that money and time spent
in going to nearby cities to do one's own investigating
is well spent. There used to be a feeling
on the part of the kindred society whose territory
was thus invaded that this action argued
lack of confidence in its work; but as the importance
of the personal contact has been more
widely recognized this feeling has disappeared.
It may be said that a worker who goes to a
strange city is handicapped by her lack of knowledge
of local conditions. This is of course true,
and it may easily be a question of how great an
advantage will be gained by the journey. The
worker from the man's home town can, however,
go far toward overcoming the handicap of unfamiliarity
with the place, as well as toward dispelling
any sense of injury in the mind of a professional
colleague, by calling first at the office of
the local agency and talking the problem over
thoroughly, consulting the map and getting what
hints the local agency may be able to furnish.
The first question to ask oneself, therefore, is
&quot;Will it not be worth while to go myself?&quot;</p>

<p>If for geographical or other reasons this is
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>impracticable, the next thing that should receive
careful consideration is the type of letter to be
written. If the situation is very emergent (as
in the case of Adolph R. cited earlier), the request
may have to be sent by telegraph; but even in
a telegram it is possible to convey some detail.
To try to save money by confining oneself to
ten words is unwise. If time admits, a letter is
more desirable, and the principle of its construction
is as simple as the Golden Rule&mdash;give the
other person all the information you would like
to have if you were receiving the letter. Where
the correspondent is not a trained social worker,
very specific suggestions and directions should
be given as to how you wish the man dealt with
if found.</p>

<p>There might also be laid down a Golden Rule
for recipients of requests from out-of-town that
missing men be traced. &quot;Give the request right-of-way
over your regular work, and send back
as prompt and as full a reply as you would wish
yourself&quot; might adequately cover the case. A
reply which contains a history of actual steps
taken as well as results gained, is more satis<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>factory
than one which does not. Good case
workers believe in reciprocity and treat their
neighbor's problem as their own. &quot;We heard
that a man we were interested in was in the
vicinity of a certain city, and in the effort to
trace him wrote to the charity organization
society in that place, but without success. Several
months later the charity organization
society saw an item in a newspaper to the effect
that the man had been interned as an enemy
alien, and notified us. (This shows no cleverness
on our part, but good work by the other
society.)&quot;</p>

which furnished the illustrations. Their replies are in part
as follows:
</p><p>
<i>Agency A.</i>&mdash;&quot;Your criticism ... is purely theoretical
and has no basis in fact. The deserter is a knowing
violator of the law, and while he does not welcome it, he
regards his arrest as only a question of time. He is playing
the game of 'hide and seek,' and he is applying every trick
and subterfuge to avoid detection. He is not disturbed if
he has been caught in a police trap. Our experience has
been that in such cases where he has tried to outwit the
police, and the police finally have 'beaten him to the game,'
he compliments his captor. This is a common characteristic
of the criminal, a sort of negative bravado, When the
deserter is arrested, all he can hope for and expect is a fair
deal.&quot;
</p><p>
What are some concrete suggestions, developed
from the experience of case workers, as to
how to proceed in searching for deserting men?
A full and careful talk with the wife is the first
requisite, supplemented by equally thorough
interviews with any near relatives who can be
reached. The case worker should be familiar
with the Questionnaire on the Deserted Family
in Mary E. Richmond's Social Diagnosis. A
description and if possible a photograph of the
man should be procured. Where several out-of-town
clues are to be followed, copies of the
photograph can be cheaply made, and at least
one bureau for dealing with desertion cases
makes this part of its routine procedure.
</p><p>
<i>Agency B.</i>&mdash;&quot;I have seen very few individuals in the
course of my experience who could not be brought to see
the right viewpoint if they were intelligently approached,
even though the probation officer had considerable to do
with their arrest. It is in my opinion not altogether important
what occurs before the man's arrest but how he is
treated after he comes within the jurisdiction of the probation
officials.&quot;</p></div>

<p class="center"><b>FURTHER ITEMS IN THE INVESTIGATION</b></p>


<p>It is evident that the need of finding the man
strongly influences the course of this type of
investigation, especially in the early stages. Are
there other considerations, however, that modify
the technique of inquiry into these desertion
cases?</p>

<p>There is one crisis in the lives of deserted
families which is not duplicated in the history
of any other group suffering from social disability.
This crisis is the period of the first
desertion. &quot;If we could learn what preceded
and what immediately followed the first desertion,
we should know much more than we do
now about how to deal with the problem,&quot;
said a case worker who has studied many court
records.</p>

<p>The <i>number</i> of subsequent desertions may be
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>both interesting and significant, but the circumstances
attending them are not nearly so well
worth study as are those connected with the
critical first break. We should go back to that
spot and probe for causes. The common practice
of recording carefully what led up to a
chronic deserter's last desertion before his family
applied, and of passing over his earlier desertions
with a mere mention of their number and
dates, puts the emphasis in the wrong place.</p>

<p>We must, however, go further back than the
first desertion for a working fund of knowledge.
The importance of knowing what were the influences
surrounding the man and woman in
childhood and youth has already been dwelt
upon and is so generally conceded as to need
no elaboration here. Of especial value also is
careful inquiry into the period of courtship, the
circumstances of the marriage, and the history
of the earlier married life. &quot;We should seek to
know what first drew them together, as well as
what forced them apart,&quot; said a thoughtful district
secretary. The notorious unhappiness of
&quot;forced marriages&quot; leads case workers to scruti<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>nize
the relation between the date of marriage
and the date of the birth of the first child. It
should be remembered, however, that not all
marriages which are entered into during pregnancy
are forced marriages. Studies of forced
marriages, so-called, have not always taken this
fact into consideration.</p>

<p>The superintendent of a state department for
aid to widows made a study of the vital statistics
of 500 families chosen at random. She states
that &quot;out of these 500 mothers 96, or 19.2 per
cent, had conceived out of wedlock&mdash;or rather
before wedlock&mdash;judging by the date of marriage
and that of the first child's birth. All
these women were hard working; several of
good standing in the neighborhood and the mothers
of large families of children.&quot; This group of
homes represents by no means an unstable segment
of the community, since in most instances
the couples had lived together in reasonable harmony
up to the time of the man's death. But
do the 96 represent forced marriages as ordinarily
thought of by the social worker? The
study just quoted has no facts bearing upon
<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>this point. The likelihood is that a large number
of these marriages, termed forced, were in
reality not brought about by outside pressure at
all, but that the couple were intending to be
married at the time the pregnancy occurred and
that the circumstances were condoned by public
opinion in the community where the marriage
took place.</p>

<p>The Chicago Juvenile Protective Association,
however, has made a study of 89 forced marriages
which were brought about in connection
with bastardy proceedings. In this study there
is no attempt to differentiate as to the <i>amount</i>
of unwillingness that had had to be overcome
on the part of either the man or the woman.
Fifty-three of the women said that the marriage
had been entered into willingly on their part.
Sixty of them stated that they were well treated
by their husbands, and only five complained of
abuse or unkindness. Out of the 89 marriages
brought about after proceedings were instituted
69 of the couples were still living together from
one to two years later, although 20, or nearly
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>one in five, had separated before the two-year
period was over.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>A young woman with four small children was given
advice by an associated charities about her approaching
confinement, and no further inquiry was made at that
time. She was living apart from her husband, who was
contributing a small amount regularly. The income was
inadequate and it was decided to push the matter further.
Efforts to verify the marriage failed. Finally, a tactful
worker was able to learn that the ceremony had not
taken place until after the birth of the first three children,
that the couple had had sexual relations since the
woman was a girl of fifteen, and that her relatives had
never known the true state of affairs. The man's mother
finally interfered, and urged her son not to live with
his wife. After much careful work, and with the assistance
of a co-operating priest, a plan was worked out
which brought the couple together and induced them to
move away from the region in which the man's parents
lived.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A probation department tells of a case where, although
the man was unwilling to marry, a court marriage was
brought about; the man made his payments promptly
and observed the other conditions of his probation faithfully.
The woman, however, was indifferent to any efforts
to bring about a reconciliation. It was finally discovered
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>that she was immoral. The case culminated in the securing
of a divorce by the man, who was granted the custody
of the children.</p>

<p>The same department submits a story where good
results were obtained in subsequently reconciling, after a
desertion, a couple whose marriage had been of the forced
description. The probation department arranged for the
couple to live apart in the early stage of probationary
treatment. A careful study was made of each of the
individuals, and in their sincere attachment a basis was
discovered for re-establishment of the home under the
supervision of the probation officer. Five years later the
man was found to be at work at the same position originally
obtained for him by the probation officer, his
salary had been increased, the family had grown in number
and were getting on extremely well.</p></blockquote>

<p>Although the term &quot;forced marriage&quot; has
come to have the meaning given above, unions
can be really forced where there has been no sex
relation before marriage. In one unhappy marriage
which came finally to a court of domestic
relations, the wife was a weak and timid woman
who married her husband because of her fear
that he would carry out his threat and kill her
and himself if she refused him. Another, an
Italian girl, was married at fourteen by her
parents against her inclinations to a well-to-do
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>man, much older than she, who was a lodger in
the family. As she grew to womanhood their
incompatibility increased; finally, after four
children had been born, the family was broken
up and the children committed to institutions.</p>

<p>There are compulsions and false motives,
operating to bring about marriages, which spring
from within not without; and the discovery of
any motive for the marriage except mutual inclination
has significance to the case worker.
Light was thrown on the troubles of one young
couple when the girl confessed that she had
married a youth for whom she had no particular
affection, in order to &quot;spite&quot; her relatives and
assert her right to do as she chose. And the
unfortunate young woman who married a street
evangelist in a fit of religious enthusiasm, and
because of his promise that they would travel
about the world saving souls together, had a
married life both short and stormy. The so-called
&quot;slacker marriages&quot; of the few months
preceding the first draft in 1917 illustrate this
point. The wreckage of these marriages is
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>already drifting in increasing amount to the
courts of domestic relations.</p>

<p>One of the most important items in desertion
cases, and one far too often neglected, is the
verification of the marriage. Much seeming indifference
and confusion on this point is probably
caused by the quasi-legality in many states
of common law marriages. The case worker
should not forget, however, that a common law
union is often only a device on the part of one
or the other of the two to avoid prosecution for
bigamy. When it is established that the marriage
is a common law union, a strong suspicion
should be set up in the worker's mind that there
may be some legal barrier to a ceremony, and
careful inquiry should be directed along this
line. Not only does the verification of a marriage
give the worker a sound basis on which to
proceed to court action if necessary, but the copy
of the actual marriage record, where that can be
procured, gives much valuable information as to
dates, addresses, and names of relatives and witnesses.
A transcript of the record will usually
be furnished by the registrar of vital statistics
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>in the city where the marriage took place (if in
the United States) for a nominal fee of fifty
cents.</p>

<p>It is much more difficult to verify marriages
which took place in other countries, and social
workers are often appalled by the prevalence of
the so-called &quot;American marriage&quot; among immigrant
deserters, who trust to our happy-go-lucky
methods for protection against a prosecution
for bigamy.</p>

<blockquote><p>Such was the case of Orfeo Pelligrini, who came to this
country and took a new wife when his children in Italy
were nearly grown. His Italian family came to America
through their own efforts a few years later, and Orfeo
found that he had underestimated the character of his
eldest son, who traced his father, had him arrested and
taken to the city where his original family was living.
Orfeo, now forcibly reunited to the wife of his bosom,
walks softly under the threat of bigamy proceedings,
while the &quot;American&quot; wife refuses to take any action on
the ground that &quot;he didn't go away from me of his own
wish, and why should I put him behind the bars?&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Of an altogether more simple mental make-up was the
Slovak laborer who brought his pregnant &quot;American
wife&quot; and two children to the district office of a charity
organization society, saying that the relatives in Europe
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>of Anna, his first wife, had sent Anna to this country, and
she was on the point of arriving. He added that, as
manifestly it was not possible to support two families on
his wages, he would like to provide for his second wife
through &quot;the Charity.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>A district secretary who has worked for many
years with Italians is authority for the statement
that marriages in Italy are always registered
at the man's legal residence, no matter
where the marriage took place. &quot;Careful Italian
parents, if they cannot get reliable information
in other ways, write to the 'paese' of a suitor for
information in regard to his conjugal condition.
A marriage which takes place in America is customarily
registered with the consul for transmission
to the home town in Italy.&quot;</p>

<p>In some countries of Latin America great confusion
may be caused by the fact that a marriage
performed in church is not legal in the eyes
of the state unless a second ceremony is gone
through before the civil authorities. A Guatemalan
woman, deserted in this country, had no
recourse in law because she had had only the
church ceremony in her country. Her claim to
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>the status of common law wife was invalidated
by the man's producing proof that he was already
married at the time the religious ceremony was
performed.</p>

<p>Having established the fact that a legal marriage
has taken place, the case worker must keep
in mind the possibility that it may have been
later dissolved. It is not at all uncommon to
find that a deserter who has gone off with another
woman has started proceedings to get a
divorce by &quot;publication.&quot; This can happen
when the two have gone to a state where such
unfair divorce procedure is permitted. Publication
in these cases takes place in local newspapers
which there is little or no chance of the
wife seeing; and she may later find herself a
divorced woman with no legal claim for support
for herself or children, and suffering under
charges of misconduct without having had a
chance of being heard. The National Desertion
Bureau found this proceeding so common an
abuse that it established a clearing bureau in
its central office, and its local representatives in
different parts of the country notify this bureau
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>as soon as any action for divorce is started by a
man with a Jewish name against a wife whose
&quot;address is unknown.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>What are some of the other points at which
the investigation of cases of desertion may differ
from the technique generally accepted? The
superintendent of a desertion bureau, in answer
to this question, said that he emphasized &quot;neighborhood
references&quot; more than in the ordinary
case. Social workers have become very wary,
of course, of much inquiry among present neighbors;
but where the protection of the woman or
the children is involved it is often necessary to
procure the testimony of people who live nearby
or in the same house. A deserted family is
usually so much a center of neighborhood interest
or sympathy, or both, that it is easier than
in some other types of cases to secure information
from neighbors, tradesmen, and so on, without
augmenting neighborhood gossip.</p>

<p><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>Probably the most difficult part of the necessary
information to be secured in desertion cases
is an adequate picture of the sex relationship
between man and wife. The part which sex
plays in the causation of desertion has been
touched upon in Chapter II.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> In getting the
information from the people concerned, the case
worker needs no elaborate equipment as a
psycho-analyst; but she should know enough
about sex psychology to recognize a pathological
problem when she meets it, and to be able to
call on the psycho-analyst or psychiatrist for
specialized service.</p>

<p>The securing of an adequate picture of the
sex life of the couple may have to be delegated,
however, to some volunteer whose own sex, profession,
or marital experience makes him or her
a suitable person to secure it.</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;The majority of social case workers are unmarried
women under forty, and in this particular respect they
frequently find themselves handicapped by the natural
reluctance of the deserter to discuss his conceptions of the
marital relation in such a way as to be enlightening to
them, as well as by the chivalrous attitude which the
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>woman of the tenements often adopts toward her unmarried
visitor. The decisive statement, 'You have
never been married, so you can't understand,' often
proves at least a temporary barrier in dealing with
deserted wives, just as the similar statement, 'You have
never been a mother so you cannot know the feelings of
one,' is used to block her efforts in another direction. If
it is found impossible to carry on the necessary discussions
rationally and without too serious embarrassment, it is
often possible to call upon the socially-minded physician
or clergyman for help along this line.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To sum up, the interviews with the family
and the supplementary visits and letters of inquiry
should furnish the social worker if possible
with:</p>

<p>1. A clear picture of the home in which the
two adult members of the family grew up, and
the factors in their early training which contributed
to their failure as husband or wife; or
which can be utilized as assets in the future
plan.</p>

<p>2. A history of how the couple met; the
events of their courtship and marriage, including
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>sex relations prior to marriage with spouse or
others; also previous marriages. Records of
marriage, death of previous spouse, etc., are
very important and should be secured if in
existence.</p>

<p>3. A picture of the family and its individual
members in their other social relationships&mdash;with
employers, medical agencies, teachers, their
church, their friends, their relatives. Knowledge
of their habits, tastes, and characteristics, with
special attention to period of first desertion.
Analysis of factors leading to the desertion.</p>

<p>4. History of first reconciliation (unless the
present is the first break). History of subsequent
desertions. Court record, if any.</p>

<p>A prerequisite to some of the above information
is an interview or interviews with the man.
Where this cannot be had as part of the first
investigation, the investigation should leave the
worker in possession of some good clues, at least,
to the man's whereabouts.</p>

<p class="center"><b>THE DETAILS OF TREATMENT</b></p>


<p>As in all other problems faced by the case
worker, it is impossible to lay down general
rules for the treatment of desertion. There may
be general considerations, however, which it is
well to keep in mind, some of which have been
advanced in the last chapter.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>On questions of investigation there is closer
agreement among social workers than on questions
of treatment. Personal factors here play
a much larger part, and it may very well be
that two case workers who differ in personality
but are of equal ability, will choose very different
plans of treatment in a given case and yet each
bring it to a successful issue. It is with a good
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>deal of hesitancy, therefore, that a case worker
ventures upon the discussion of anything so
flexible as treatment. In preparation for this
study many consultations were had with practising
social case workers in the fields of family
work, probation, medical-social service, and child
welfare. Differences of opinion were found and
this chapter will attempt to express the composite
opinion on how to treat the deserter and his
family in the different situations which confront
them.</p>


<p><b>1. Man's Whereabouts Unknown but Desertion of
Recent Date.</b>&mdash;It is better in this case to make no
very definite plans for the family. Emergent
plans, both as to relief and medical or other
care should, of course, be prompt and adequate.
Now is the time, if it can be done, to win the
confidence and co-operation of the wife. We
should, however, make no promises for the sake
of &quot;buying&quot; co-operation, and give no premature
advice either as to prosecution or reconciliation.
Everything possible should be done to strengthen
such ties with church, relatives, and friends as
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>may be helpful, but the social worker should be
slow to encourage the family to form new ties
with other social agencies at this time. She
should avoid the possibility of judging the
woman harshly in a period of stress, but be
watchful for signs of deterioration and resourceful
to combat them. This is the stage, of course,
when all energies should be bent toward finding
the man.</p>

<p>In this as in the other situations about to be
discussed, the question of whether or not the
home should be broken up and the children
committed should be decided on other grounds
than on the desertion alone. Under many circumstances,
it is the best thing to do. The
woman, worn out with anxiety or abuse, may be
unequal to their physical care for the present;
or they may be running wild and in danger of
becoming delinquent. The mother may be
morally an unfit guardian, and the desertion
may furnish the long-sought opportunity to
interfere for the children's protection. Commitment
may have to be planned, and the
mother's consent won, to save the children from
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>the return of a brutal father, against whom she
cannot protect them. Or she may desire a
temporary commitment in order to give her
husband a severe lesson. The main consideration,
however, ought to be what is going, in
the long run, to be best for the children concerned.</p>


<p><b>2. Man's Whereabouts Unknown, Desertion of
Long Standing.</b>&mdash;A very different problem from
the preceding may be presented in the family
of a man who disappeared some time ago. Where
the desertion is bona fide and has persisted over
a period of years, it is often possible to treat
the family as if the man were dead, and, if other
circumstances make this advisable, to plan comprehensively
for the future. There is always the
chance, however, that, until the man's death is
established, he may turn up unexpectedly. If
living, he usually manages to hear now and
again about his family and is often able to find
them at will. A man who had neither seen nor
communicated with his family during the ten
years they had been maintained by a private
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>family agency, nevertheless sent promptly for
his wife and eldest son by a messenger who
knew exactly where to find them (although they
had moved in the interval several times), when
he lay dying of alcoholic excess in the city
hospital.</p>

<p>The laws of many states contain a provision
that the marriage of a person who has completely
disappeared and not been heard from in a period
of years can be set aside by the proper authorities.
This makes legal the remarriage of the
spouse. In nearly all of the states divorce can
be obtained on the ground of long continued
desertion.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The wisdom of advising such a divorce,
however, should receive careful individual
consideration, particularly in relation to the religious
faith of the client and the attitude of
that faith toward divorce.</p>

<p><b>3. Man's Whereabouts Known; Man Unwilling to
Return or Support.</b>&mdash;Many types of deserting men
are included under this catch-all heading&mdash;the
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>so-called &quot;justifiable deserter;&quot; the man who
has fled to escape his creditors or is a fugitive
from justice; the man who has elected to try
life with another mate; the wandering hobo who
means to come back some sweet day but not
now; the cowardly pregnancy deserter; the low-grade
irresponsible&mdash;a motley crew. They are
grouped together here for convenience, since
they constitute those with whom coercive measures
have most often to be used.</p>

<blockquote><p>A good example of the &quot;justifiable deserter&quot; is found
in the story of Williams.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> This man, when home conditions
became intolerable, tried to secure his children's
safety through the courts but did not obtain a hearing.
He left home feeling that he was fully justified. The
lame point in his self-defense was his failure to support
his children, and it took a court order to rectify this in
part.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Joseph Mellor is in a more logical situation in his
refusal to provide for his wife, since he is paying the
board of his child in a good institution. He makes no
charge against her character, but insists that her quarrelsome
and dictatorial disposition makes her impossible
to live with. She had haled him so many times into
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>court and lost him so many positions that Mellor, who
earns a good salary, will deal with her only through his
lawyer, who keeps his client's whereabouts secret and
will not trust the social worker interested even to the
extent of arranging an interview.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is generally impossible in cases of such
deep-seated antagonism to make any plans looking
toward reconciliation. The &quot;justifiable deserter&quot;
can usually be reasoned with, and once
he understands and admits his responsibilities,
can often be made to live up to them without
judicial process.</p>

<blockquote><p>A ship steward deserted his wife, who was both alcoholic
and paretic, taking with him his only child whom
he placed with his relatives. The woman was devoted
to the boy and broken in spirit because she was not allowed
to see him. The steward claimed, probably correctly,
that he was not responsible for the woman's
syphilitic condition. The following extract from the
record of the first interview with the man is quoted to
show the lines of argument which were effective with
him:</p>

<p>&quot;Man at District Office&mdash;Visitor started in immediately
with the subject in hand, thinking he was the
sort that would respond to absolutely direct dealing.
Explained to him that we had been given to understand
his wife was ill, not only from alcoholism but also
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>from other complications; that it was suspected there
might be some difficulty with her blood and that we had
been advised that her mental condition was not now as
strong as it had been previously. Explained to him that
he was absolutely responsible for his wife, for her support,
and for her care and protection, and that no matter
how far he traveled, his responsibility remained the same;
that he had assumed this when he married her. Said
that he felt no responsibility for her whatsoever, that
he had done all he ever would do for her and intended
to devote his efforts toward his child. Visitor explained
to him that woman's intemperance might perfectly well
be a disease over which it would be very difficult for
her to have control; that, moreover, if she were suffering
also from a blood condition, this should have treatment.
Explained that he would more nearly meet his
responsibilities were he to have her examined and send
her where she could procure the treatment required, even
if it meant commitment to an institution. At this
point man seemed more interested, particularly as visitor
told him that Arthur would grow up and would want
to know where his mother was and what had become of
her; and if man had left her sick and alone, at the
mercy of strangers, he would not be able to give an
adequate accounting to his son. Man's reaction was not
what visitor had expected&mdash;he would be glad to put her
away where she could not trouble him any more but he
did not intend to expend any more money. Said he was
under too heavy expenses with Arthur. Claimed he
was making $70 a month, and visitor forced him to add
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>that he got in addition his board and lodging on the
ship, so that he was under no expense except when on
shore leave. Visitor repeated that as a husband he was
required to pay for woman's care, that that was the
right thing to do; that one way he would be a husband
deserting his wife, liable to arrest for non-support and
desertion, and the other way a husband with a sick wife
for whom he was willing to provide the medical attention
and care that every sick person has a right to have.
He said if it was a question of a few dollars a week, he
supposed he would be willing to do it, and visitor felt
he really was willing to do the right thing if he only
could be assured that woman would not interfere with
Arthur. Said he would never let woman see the child,
but finally admitted, if she were not drunk and was in
the hospital and it would do any good, he supposed she
could.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>With persistent or recalcitrant deserters as a
group, court action has very often to be invoked.
Procedure in this direction differs so
much in different communities that only general
observations can be offered here. If the
man has left his home but not the town and is
still within the jurisdiction of the local court, the
magistrate will usually issue a summons (which
in many cities the wife is expected to serve)
calling on the man to appear at court on the
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>date set for the hearing. If he fails to appear a
warrant for his arrest is issued. If he has left
the city but not the state, local courts may issue
warrants, which can be mailed to the city to
which the man has gone and served by the
police there; or an officer may be sent from the
home town with a warrant to arrest the man
and bring him back.</p>

<p>Prior to his arraignment, the best court practice
calls for an investigation by the probation
officer, so that the judge may have substantiated
facts before him when the case comes up.
Whether this is done or not here is the time
and place for the social worker who already
knows the family to get his knowledge in usable
fashion before the court. How best to do this
varies greatly in different communities. Sometimes
the social worker is permitted to talk
the matter over with the judge personally, sometimes
with the probation officer, clerk or other
court official. Sometimes a written report is
required, to be attached to the probation officer's
report. Occasionally the social worker
gets no chance to be heard unless he is present
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>to testify in open court. In the last two contingencies,
care must be taken to safeguard information
given in confidence, even by the deserter.
Letters marked &quot;confidential&quot; should
not ordinarily be submitted in court except by
consent of the writer, as some judges hold that
material so submitted becomes a matter of
public record.</p>

<p>The approach to the court, therefore, is governed
by local conditions. A very important
part of co-operation in any community is to
see that this channel is kept free from obstruction.
In general, the probation officer should
be the best friend of the other social workers,
since he knows their language. Indeed, many
social workers themselves combine the office of
probation officer with their other duties.</p>

<p>After the institution of court proceedings the
outside social worker has usually little chance to
affect the disposition of the case. This is made
by the judge on the basis of the testimony he
elicits in court, and on that of any preliminary
investigation he may have caused to be made.
Disposition may be:<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></p>

<blockquote><p>1. In rare instances, to dismiss the complaint altogether.</p>

<p>2. To remand for a later hearing.</p>

<p>3. To induce the woman to drop her complaint and
give the man another chance.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>4. To place the man under court order to stay away
from home and pay his wife a stated amount weekly.
Custom differs in different places as to whether payment
shall be direct to the wife, through the probation officer
or clerk of court, or through public or private charities.</p>

<p>5. To order the man to return home and contribute a
stated amount.</p>

<p>6. To place on probation (together with either 4 or 5).</p>

<p>7. Commitment&mdash;usually to jail or workhouse, and
for a period of not over six months. May be longer for
violation of probation or for aggravated offense.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the deserting man has gone without
the borders of the state, there is the added
problem of securing his extradition, which is
often a difficult one. Wife desertion is in most
states only a misdemeanor (in New York it is
even less serious and constitutes in the eye of
the law only disorderly conduct). Since extradition
between states has to be acted upon by
the governors of the states, it is unusual (though
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>not impossible<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>) to secure extradition for a misdemeanor.
The reluctance of the authorities is
understandable, however, when it is realized
that to extradite for wife desertion would be to
create a precedent for extradition for any sort
of misdemeanor. There is in most states a law
which makes the abandonment of a minor child
or children a felony, punishable by a long term
in state prison, and it is this law which is generally
invoked when the man has been traced
to another state. Complaint then has to be
made to the district (or county) attorney, the
matter taken before the grand jury and an indictment
secured before extradition papers can be
granted. The man, if captured, must usually
be tried in a higher court than the domestic
relations court; if convicted he is likely to be
more severely punished. Extradition means
expense to the state; it is usually difficult,
moreover, to get an active interest taken in
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>extraditing a family deserter who, to the legal
eye, has committed an offense neither against
the person nor against property, and cannot
therefore be a serious offender!</p>

<p>If extradition for family desertion is difficult
between states, with other countries it is impossible,
as no treaties exist even with contiguous
countries like Canada and Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> By
special arrangement with the Canadian authorities,
states which touch the Canadian border can
sometimes obtain the person of a deserter without
actual extradition. Information is submitted
to the police of the Canadian town where
the man is known to be, who thereupon arrest
him as an &quot;undesirable citizen&quot; and arrange for
his deportation. The neighboring state is notified,
and an officer with a warrant meets the
Canadian officer and the prisoner at the boundary,
arresting the latter as soon as he sets foot
across the state line.</p>

<p>The testimony of social workers is, in the main,
in favor of probation as against long prison sentence
for men of this type. &quot;We have found a
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>shortened penitentiary sentence, with release on
probation, very successful in a number of instances.&quot;
&quot;Sometimes the probation has been
more effective by its being a sort of double probation;
that is, having the case pending in
juvenile court as well as municipal or district
court. The fear of having his children permanently
taken from him if he again fails to
support them has, in one or two instances, had
much more effect with the deserter than the
threat of a prison sentence.&quot; &quot;Probation works
very well and occasionally a prison sentence;
but probation is better.&quot; These statements
come from cities where probation work is well
organized. From another city where the probation
officers are notoriously overworked, comes
a pessimistic note: &quot;The theory of probation is
fine, but the practice is poor because the officers
have entirely too much to do.&quot;</p>

<p>Probation is simply case work with the added
&quot;punch&quot; of the law behind it; so that when it
is at all well done it should have the more lasting
results. Probation officers and other social
workers agree, however, that for certain deserters
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>of the complacent type, an unexpected prison
sentence is sometimes a very salutary dash of
cold water.</p>

<blockquote><p>After having tried one or two short absences, ostensibly
to look for work and finding that nothing serious
happened to him, Andreas Gorokhoff walked out one
day and did not come back for five years. During that
time his wife's relatives and the community's family
agency took care of his family while he led the life of a
care-free vagabond. He was ready upon his return to
settle down again for a time; but the family agency and
the probation department thought differently, and succeeded
in having him sent to state prison for an indeterminate
sentence of not more than two years. He was
released on parole for good conduct, returned home,
went to work, and, during the four years which have
since elapsed, all has gone well.</p></blockquote>

<p>Good results may, and probably more often
do, follow shorter prison sentences.</p>

<blockquote><p>A man on probation for intemperance, broke it and
deserted. On account of the children's keen feeling
about the consequent disgrace, the wife made no move
until urged thereto by the social worker interested. Her
husband was then arrested in a nearby city and brought
back, much surprised at the firm stand his wife had
taken. He was sentenced to four months, served two,
and was released on parole. Since his return he has not
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>been drinking and has been contributing satisfactorily
toward the support of his family.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The first step taken by Harvey Brand when released
from the workhouse after a short prison sentence, was
to stop in at a furniture store and order a green plush
parlor &quot;suit&quot; on the instalment plan. Harvey had never
been conspicuously interested in his home before, and
the district secretary and her committee were aghast at
this new evidence of his irresponsibility. The green plush
was, however, the outward sign of an inner burgeoning,
and it warmed the heart of Mrs. Harvey as nothing else
could have done. From that time, Harvey, with judicious
encouragement over a few hard spots, has become
a good family man and a regular provider.</p></blockquote>

<p>The particular problem involved in the treatment
of the family during the trial and imprisonment
of the deserter is that of encouraging
the woman to stick to her guns. If she withdraws
her complaint or secures his release before
his time is up, she not only convinces him of her
lack of firmness but the entry in the court
record seriously prejudices her case should she
make complaint there again. Unless the social
worker is convinced, therefore, that the sentence
has been unduly severe, the wife should be encouraged
in every way to let her husband serve
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>out his time. If a policy of relief has been
necessary, care should be taken that it be
adequate, so that economic pressure will not
induce her to ask for his release. If the home
has been broken up and the children committed,
the mother's loneliness and desire to have her
home back is likely to work in the same way.
The hope of making her husband kinder when
he returns often leads a woman to ask for his
release. The pressure of relatives and friends,
and sometimes of her church is likely to be
exerted in the same direction and unknown to
the social worker. Chaplains of correctional
institutions, interested entirely in the man and
with no knowledge of the family situation, are
also likely to appear in the case; and it is well
to acquaint them, in the beginning, of our interest
and our hope that no step will be taken
without a consultation. If it is hoped or expected
that the man will return to his home
after imprisonment, he should be earnestly cultivated
by the social worker while he is serving
his time. Visits and letters will go far toward
breaking down his resentment at the part the
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>worker is likely to have played in &quot;putting him
behind the bars.&quot; Now is an excellent time to
introduce a man as volunteer visitor to the
prisoner, if he is to be off probation when released.
If imprisonment or: &quot;stay-away probation&quot;
does not have the desired effect of making
the deserter willing and anxious to return to his
family and take care of them, or if for any
reason return is permanently undesirable, the
advisability of obtaining a legal separation<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
should be considered at this point. If, on the
other hand, the man evinces eagerness to return
home and support his family, he comes automatically
(though belatedly) into the class to be
considered in the next chapter.</p>

<p class="center"><b>THE DETAILS OF TREATMENT (Continued)</b></p>


<p>There remains a fourth classification under
treatment, of cases which demand even more
individualized care and therefore more extended
comment than those just considered.</p>


<p><b>4. Man's Whereabouts Known; Man Willing to
Return.</b>&mdash;Here the question to determine is
whether it is going to be a desirable thing for
the man to re-enter the home and, if so, when.
This does not always lie within the power of
the case worker to decide; the couple may and
often do resolve their differences for the time
being without reference to her opinion. But
she can often hasten, defer, or even prevent the
reconciliation. Careful consideration must be
given the elements involved: What causes probably
operated to bring about the rupture in
family relations? If there have been other de<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>sertions
what does their history show? Is the
man's willingness to return a sign of real change
of heart and purpose, or is he merely afraid of
punishment? Are his habits such as to make
him a fit inmate of the home? Is he capable of
supporting the family? Can any adjustment of
temperaments be made which will lessen incompatibility?
Is the wife willing to have him return?
What are her motives? Has she enough
firmness of character to carry out a plan to
which she has agreed? These are only a few of
the questions to which the social worker needs
to know the answer, if the decision is to be a
wise one.</p>

<p>If none of the elements is present in the home
out of which family life can be reconstructed,
if the man's self-indulgence and cruelty have
been proved beyond any doubt, or if affection
is dead or never existed, then the decision may
have to be that no reconciliation be attempted.
In many cases the question then is how best to
protect the woman and children against the
man's forcing his way upon them. Court intervention
is usually necessary here, if it has not
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>already taken place; and a first step is to have
the husband placed under a court order to give
separate support and to stay away from his
home.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The wife should be armed with a warrant
for his arrest, which can be served by the
policeman on the beat if the man appears. Such
a man usually considers that his proprietorship
of the home and the family is not affected by his
absence or even by court orders, and when fortified
by liquor he is likely to force his entrance
into the home and perhaps do harm. The protection
of the warrant is not absolute; in such
cases as this it ought later to be reinforced by a
legal separation. Social workers avail themselves
of this resource far less than they should. It
controverts the principles of no religious sect
and gives all the protection of absolute divorce
(including the payment of alimony) to the
woman and children. To the children it is likely
to give more protection than divorce; for in the
event of the divorced husband's remarriage the
children of the second wife have prior rights over
those of the first, and legal separation makes this
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>impossible by preventing the remarriage of either
party. Proceedings for a legal separation cannot
usually be started if a man is on probation,
but may be while he is undergoing imprisonment.
It should be said that, after a separation, claims
for non-payment of alimony cannot, in many
states, be pressed in a court of domestic relations
but must go to a civil court. This is usually
more expensive and less satisfactory.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Some social workers even advance the heretical
doctrine that support secured through the court
from a cruel and dangerous husband does not
make up for the harm he may do and the anxiety
he causes. If to force him into periodical payments
means that he will be continually excited
into seeking out and &quot;beating up&quot; his offending
wife, the support she is able to extort from him
comes high. It is sometimes necessary to move
a family to new quarters and actually help them
to hide from the pursuit of one of these insistent
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>gentry. Even if we have some doubt that the
wife's protestations of fear or aversion are genuine,
we should hardly take the risk of revealing
her address if she wishes it kept secret. This
precaution applies not only to the man but to
anyone whom we suspect of being interested on
his behalf. A district secretary continued to
refuse the address of his family to a dangerous
epileptic deserter who threatened the secretary's
life and, in the opinion of physicians who examined
him, was likely to carry out his threat.</p>

<blockquote><p>The committee on difficult cases in a family social
agency voted to refuse to accept voluntary payments
from a thoroughly worthless deserter and transmit them
to his wife whose address he was seeking to learn, on the
theory that it was better for her and her children to be
entirely quit of him, and that nothing would make him
realize the finality of the decision more than to refuse
his money. The agency, it was felt, would be in better
position to protect the wife and children if it refused to
act as post office for the man.</p></blockquote>

<p>The same consideration might apply in questions
of extradition. When the whereabouts of
a deserter of this type has been discovered in
another city a safe distance away, it may be
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>wiser to sacrifice the money he might be forced
to contribute than to have him brought within
arm's length of his wife and family.</p>

<p>A prime difficulty in dealing with the undesirable
husband who is willing to come home is
often the attitude of the wife. Some of the
causes at work when a woman takes her husband
back have been discussed earlier.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Unfortunately,
hopelessly bad husbands profit by them
as well as hopeful ones. The policy of niggardly
relief to a deserted wife has undoubtedly been
responsible for many of these unfortunate attempts
to patch up a life together. &quot;She was
worn down by her efforts to keep the household
going, and, when the faint chance of her husband's
supporting her appeared, she took it&quot; is
the explanation given by a case worker of one
unpromising reconciliation, and she goes on to
say of this and another similar story: &quot;With
both of these it seems that enough money put
into the household to enable these mothers to
be with their children more and to keep up a
reasonable standard of health for themselves
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>might have resulted in their refusing to take
back their husbands.... Our records seem
to show that inadequate relief, making life fairly
hard for the deserted mother, does not tend to
keep the man from returning or others from
deserting.&quot;</p>

<blockquote><p>The story of Mrs. Francis shows the effect of adequate
relief in strengthening her decision not to take her husband
back. He had been a chronic deserter for years,
had drank heavily, been foul-mouthed and abusive, while
failing to support the family when at home, so that Mrs.
Francis had only a little harder time when he was away.
His last desertion took place when she was near confinement.
Owing to her condition, the church and a family
agency co-operated in an unusually generous relief policy.
This was in a state which gave mother's aid to deserted
wives. After about a year this was secured for her, and
the health of woman and children was built up and the
home improved. Then Mr. Francis sent ambassadors in
the form of relatives, with whom Mrs. Francis refused to
treat. He later appeared himself, but she would not
consider taking him back. He escaped before he could
be brought into court. As he has now been gone over
two years, it seems that her stand is a genuine one.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, when the man has been
found and interviewed, he may show signs of
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>repentance, and the earlier history, together
with the opinion which the social worker has
been able to form about the character of man
and woman may make it seem that a reconciliation
should be encouraged. A further question
then arises: Shall the man return to his home
at once or first undergo a probationary period?</p>

<p>The quick reconciliation has been a feature
of the work in domestic relations courts from
the beginning of the movement. In connection
with some courts there are special officers whose
duty it is to prevail upon couples who come to
the court to patch up their differences and give
each other another trial. This would be an
admirable procedure if the couples to receive
such treatment were selected by a process of
careful investigation, and if probationary supervision
were continued long enough to ascertain
whether permanent results could be secured. As
it actually works out it is a little like expecting
a wound to heal &quot;by first intention&quot; when it
has not been cleaned out thoroughly, and when
no attention is being paid to subsequent dressings.<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;The wholesale attempt to patch the tattered fabric
of family life in a series of hurried interviews held in the
court room, and without any information about the problem
except what can be gained from the two people concerned,
can hardly be of permanent value in most cases.
It is natural that case workers, keenly aware as they are
of the slow and difficult processes involved in character-rebuilding,
look askance at the court-made reconciliations.
With the best will in the world, the people who
attempt this delicate service very often have neither the
time nor the facts about the particular case in question
to give the skilful and devoted personal service necessary
to reconstruction. As a result many weak-willed wrong-doers
are encouraged to take a pledge of good conduct
which they will not, or cannot, keep; and other individuals
who feel themselves deeply wronged go away
with an additional sense of those wrongs having been
underestimated and of having received no redress. The
results are written in discouragement and in repeated
failures to live in harmony, each of which makes a permanent
solution more and more difficult. The case
worker to whom the results of the externally imposed
reconciliation come back again and again has reason to
be confirmed in a distrust of short-cut methods.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A probation officer writes: &quot;Superficial reconciliations
invariably result unsatisfactorily. In one case a recon<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>ciliation
was effected before the husband was released on
probation. This was done apparently in the hope that
it would influence the court in the disposition of the case.
After a study of the situation had been made by the probation
officer, it was found that the wife was totally
incompetent as a housekeeper, that she possessed an
antagonistic disposition, had a violent temper, and that
no sincere attachment for each other existed between the
couple. Before any constructive measures could be carried
out by the probation officer to remedy this situation
they separated, and it was not possible thereafter to
adjust the differences with any degree of satisfaction.</p>

<p>&quot;On another occasion a man who had a previous
prison record and had displayed criminal tendencies was
arrested for desertion. His wife, a feeble-minded woman
with one child, was being maintained at a private institution
at county expense. Through the efforts of the
district attorney a reconciliation was effected before the
case was disposed of in court, and the man was placed
on probation upon the recommendation of the prosecutor
without the usual preliminary investigation by the probation
department. The couple began to live together
contrary to the advice of the probation officer. About
two months later the man was arrested for committing
a series of burglaries and the woman was found to be
pregnant. Efforts which had been made by the probation
department to determine her mentality disclosed
her to be feeble-minded; later she was committed to a
custodial institution for feeble-minded women of
child-bearing age. The man was committed to a state prison.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>However, when youth and high temper seem
to have caused the trouble and there is real
affection to build upon, a speedy resumption of
life together is usually the best thing.</p>

<blockquote><p>A young woman with one baby said that her husband
had got drunk and threatened her with a knife. They
quarreled and he went to relatives in another city.
Neighbors testified how devoted the couple had been to
each other, describing the young man as handy about
the house though &quot;lazy about finding work.&quot; He was
visited by the family social agency in the city to which
he had gone, and wrote a penitent letter asking to come
home. The wife agreed; the man immediately returned,
got work, and succeeded in overcoming his incipient bad
habits. The death of the baby soon after his return
seemed only to draw the couple more closely together.
The case was soon after closed; nothing has been heard
in the three years since to indicate that any further
trouble has developed.</p></blockquote>

<p>A study recently made under the auspices of
the Philadelphia Court of Domestic Relations
seems to show somewhat better results from
court reconciliations than might have been expected.
One thousand and two couples who
were reconciled in court during the year 1916
were visited from six to eighteen months later.<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>
Three hundred and ten had separated or had
had further differences which brought them to
court; 87 could not be found, and 605, or about
60 per cent, were found to be still living together,
though with a varying degree of marital happiness,
as the report somewhat drily states.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>It should be said that many of these families
were probably under the supervision of a probation
officer for a longer or shorter period after
the reconciliation took place. There is no statement
as to the number of repeated deserters
among the men, and we cannot estimate how
many of the 605 fell within the group which
might chance to have the proper basis for reconciliation.</p>

<p>The practice of the Desertion Bureau maintained
by the New York Association for Improving
the Condition of the Poor is as a rule
not to advise reconciliations without a definite
preliminary period during which the man shall
contribute regularly and show that he means
business. &quot;The kind of reconciliation that lasts
is the one that is effected with some difficulty
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>to the man,&quot; its secretary remarked. The same
probation department which furnished the stories
of hasty and unsuccessful reconciliations,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> contributes
this remarkable account of the restoration
of a family through slow and careful character
rebuilding:</p>

<blockquote><p>George Latham had shamefully neglected his wife and
children for several years. He drank to excess, gambled
considerably, and associated with women of loose character.
He came from good stock, however, and his early
training had been excellent. The differences between
man and wife seemed impossible to adjust. After the
man's release on probation, the co-operation of relatives
was secured and through the aid of his new found employer
efforts were made toward a reconciliation. The
man was gradually led away from his old harmful pursuits
and tendencies, these being replaced by wholesome
activities. He was induced to join a fraternal organization,
to take out insurance for his wife and child, was
encouraged to attend church regularly, and to open a
bank account. When his sincerity was appreciated by
the wife, she agreed to resume housekeeping. Under
the direction of the probation officer, new furniture was
purchased and the home re-established. This man today
holds a responsible position under the employer who
aided in his rehabilitation, and occupies a respected place
in the community.</p></blockquote>

<p><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>Very many processes are indicated in such a
story. To bring about the conviction of wrong-doing,
to awaken desire and supply an incentive,
to keep the hope of attainment alive, to
encourage weakened nerves in a new and persistent
effort, and all the while to build and
strengthen and develop faculties and powers
that had been dormant and well-nigh destroyed,
is a task that demands a high order of skill and
resourcefulness.</p>

<p>The story just told emphasizes the work which
was done with the husband. Equally careful
work had undoubtedly to be done with the wife
to carry her along with the plan. The period of
&quot;stay-away probation&quot; for the man is a difficult
time for the woman. Neighbors and friends
know that he is taking steps in the direction of
reformation, and often hold the attitude that it
is her duty to let bygones be bygones and receive
him again. The promptings of her own heart
are often in the same direction; and affection
not outlived combines with custom, religious
precept, and economic pressure to make it
almost impossible to hold to her decision. The
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>social worker can sometimes slip some of the
burden of the decision off the woman's shoulders
to her own by exacting a promise from the two
that they will not try living together until the
man has &quot;shown what he can do&quot; for a certain
definite time. The economic pressure can be
eased by a wise policy of relief; but most of all
such a woman needs continued encouragement
from a person whose judgment and kindliness
she has learned to trust. This is another good
point at which to introduce the right kind of
volunteer visitor, one who will already have
established friendly relations with both when the
time of readjustment comes, and who can help
bridge over that difficult period. In some cases
it might be possible and desirable to procure as
volunteer visitors to a couple whose marital relations
have come to shipwreck, another married
couple who have learned how to live together
successfully.</p>

<p>The use of carefully chosen volunteers in
effecting reconciliations by the case work method
has been singularly little developed. In this
respect modern theory and practice have both
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>fallen behind.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Especially is it an opportunity
to enlist the service of men, whom it is easy to
interest in a problem that seems to focus about
the man of the family. A man volunteer can
search for a deserter in places where a woman,
by being conspicuous, would defeat her own end.
&quot;Located man by mingling with longshoremen
on the docks where he usually worked&quot; could
hardly be the entry of a woman visitor. A man
can also be very useful in court cases, to counteract
the prejudice that sometimes exists in court
rooms against the testimony of social workers
who are women. In the more subtle processes
of winning the man's confidence and helping
him to regenerate his life and recover his home
there is no preponderance of testimony in favor
of the man visitor. Sex lines vanish here;
the good case worker, man or woman, volunteer
or professional, is the person needed.</p>

<p>Sometimes the difficulty is not to deter the
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>wife from prematurely taking her husband back
but to induce her to relent when the proper
time comes.</p>

<blockquote><p>Martin Long was intemperate, his wife was high-tempered;
her relatives advised her to leave him and he
deserted, leaving the relatives to provide for her and the
three children. He was away two years; then, becoming
homesick and wanting to re-establish his home if possible,
he returned. The wife caused his arrest when he
was seeking an interview with her. The probation officer
in whose care he was released became convinced of his
genuine sincerity and regret, but the wife, still on the
advice of her relatives, refused to see him. He persisted
in his hope of a reconciliation and made extraordinary
efforts during a winter of industrial depression, putting
his pride in his pocket and taking laborer's work, which
he had never done before. He finally got a good position
and saved money enough to begin housekeeping. The
probation officer kept in touch with the wife, first persuading
her to receive a letter from Mr. Long and answer
it through the probation office. He interested her in the
details of her husband's struggle, and finally, after a
whole year of probation and with the help of her pastor,
he induced her to return. The probation officer kept in
close touch with the family for some months and reports:
&quot;Three years have elapsed since that time; the family
is now in a nearby city where they are living harmoniously
and in comfortable circumstances.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>A case worker who is remarkable for her suc<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>cess
in the treatment of estranged couples, when
asked how she did it answered laconically,
&quot;talks and talks and talks.&quot; A study of her
case records, however, shows certain points that
recur again and again in her treatment.</p>

<p>She encourages man and wife, separately, to
talk out their grievances thoroughly and get
everything out of their systems. She then proceeds
(with a lavish expenditure of time, as indicated
in her phrase) to convince each that she
is a friend, but an impartial friend. She does
not push for an immediate reconciliation, is
much more likely to recommend a temporary
separation until tempers cool down and the
true facts appear. She always advises strongly
against &quot;argument&quot; and &quot;casting up&quot; the past,
and tells the couple to come back to her if they
want to discuss their grievances further. Above
all, they are not to retail their troubles to relatives
and friends. If either or both are out of the
city during their separation she keeps in close
touch with them by letter. She is quick to
utilize their interest in their children as a means
of reawakening their interest in each other. The
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>following letters illustrate her method. The
first was written to a young man who was serving
a six months' sentence for desertion; the others
to the same young man after he had begun a
manful struggle to &quot;come back,&quot; working in a
munitions plant in another state and later sending
money regularly to the wife, who still obdurately
refused to forgive him. (The letters are
part of a series of 27 which were written to him
during a ten months' period.)</p>

<blockquote><p><i>My dear Mr. Andrews:</i></p>

<p>I was ever so glad to get your letter this week and I
am sorry that no one has been over [to the workhouse]
to see you recently. I will surely be over within the
next two weeks. I know you are anxious and you should
have had a letter telling you about the children. They
are both all right now and the baby is out of the hospital.</p>

<p>We have had a nice talk with your aunt and she is
very anxious to come over and see you. We will all get
together and try and plan what is the right thing to do
when you come out. I will arrange it so we can have a
little longer talk this time if possible.</p>

<p>Very truly yours,</p>

<p>DISTRICT SECRETARY.</p>


<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p><i>My dear Mr. Andrews:</i></p>

<p>Your long letter has just arrived. I read it with a
great deal of interest and pleasure. It is fine to know
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>you have already arrived and have started out to make
good on your promises.</p>

<p>I got your cards during the week, which brought the
news of your journey. Also on Tuesday morning came
your last letter, expressing your appreciation for all we
had tried to do for you and enclosing two more thrift
stamps for the children. I put these in their books.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had a nice long letter from your father,
enclosing one for me to give to you. I am sending it
on just as it is. I was very much tempted to read it
but have not done so. The reason I was tempted was
that I know it must be full of happiness to think you
have made such a good start. At least that was the
tone of the letter he wrote to me.</p>

<p>During the past years I have worked for this society
I have seen many people &quot;come back&quot; strong, and
always it has been because they had some big motive in
life and reason for making good. But I have seldom
known a fellow that had so many reasons why he should
make good. You have the confidence of your father and
your aunt. You have the children for whom you will
do right. You have Clara, whom you have wronged
and whom you will have to teach all over again to trust
you. Surely all these things added to your own firm will
to try and undo all the unhappiness you have given
people, ought to help you every day as you prove the
good stuff that is in you.</p>

<p>I, of course, telephoned Clara of your starting off and
yesterday she came to the office and we had a long talk.
She is only sorry that you did not see the baby and says
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>she will be only too glad to have special pictures taken
of the children to send you. This was after I suggested
that she let me take a snapshot of them to send you.</p>

<p>Be sure and write to your father and aunt often.
And please remember my last instructions, which were
to let me know fully about yourself. When you write,
tell me all about the camp life; how they arrange the
living; how long hours you have to work; what they
give you for recreation, etc. Pick out for your friends
men who can help you, not hinder you, in your good
determinations, and hope there will be at least one man
there in whom you can trust and to whom you can go
for advice.</p>

<p>I will let you know about the children all the time.
Clara says Nellie [the small daughter] was expecting to
see you again. Don't worry, she will never forget you.</p>

<p>With all good wishes,</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>DISTRICT SECRETARY.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><i>My dear Mr. Andrews:</i></p>

<p>I received your long letter this morning and was very
glad to hear all the details of camp life. It is too bad
that your surroundings are not more comfortable, but I
am sure you can stick it out for awhile. If you can
raise yourself to be foreman, will you then have to live
in the same uncomfortable quarters? Although I don't
know the details, I should think it would be well if you
did sign up for the six months. It is too bad that your
throat is still hoarse.</p>

<p><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>Thank you for letting me see your father's letter.
I am enclosing it. I hope you are keeping in touch with
him.</p>

<p>You asked especially about Clara and whether she
asked for you. Of course she did, and she wants me to
say if there is anything you want to say to her you can
send the letter here and she will write you. She thinks
that your ambition and determination to make good is
fine, and she will try and help you in every way. She
has not been in this week and I have been very busy,
but I shall make it my business to see her early next
week, and if she has not had the pictures of the children
taken, I will get that attended to myself.</p>

<p>So far as I can see there is absolutely nothing for you
to worry about from this end of the line. Clara is at
last, I think, as fully self-convinced as I am that you are
making a splendid effort, and she is perfectly willing to
be fair in waiting until you have a chance to get turned
around financially and in making first payment for the
children.</p>

<p>Next week I am going to send you down a book to
read. It is one I have enjoyed myself, and perhaps some
evenings when you are not too tired you will get a chance
to glance over it. It is small and you can put it in your
pocket. Be very sure I have not forgotten the very satisfactory
talks we had and the splendid way you have
grimly started out to make good. If you can help the
Government do their work, even down there, give it a
good try out. Never mind the different nationalities
you have to mix with. You have already knocked
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>around the world so much that you can just consider
this another opportunity of getting to know a great
variety of people. You might even learn to talk Italian
and Greek! There is no experience in life we have to go
through but can be a source of great education to us.
You are sure to win out and get the respect of everybody,
your fellow-workmen as well as your superior
officers, if you continuously day in and day out simply
refuse to get discouraged and keep up your work and
do as you are told. Stick by.</p>

<p>With all good wishes,</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>DISTRICT SECRETARY.</p></blockquote>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>But when all is said and done, there are no
unbreakable rules about treatment. A form of
treatment is sometimes to do nothing at all.</p>

<blockquote><p>Charles Morgan, a middle-aged machinist with a wife,
a comfortable home, and seven children (the two eldest
grown), picked up his tools and disappeared, after a
quarrel over his wife's extravagance. He had been earning
$50 a week in a shop where he had worked for eighteen
years and he would not endure having his wages
garnisheed for debt.</p>

<p>An experienced case worker to whom furious Mrs.
Morgan made her complaint, decided, after studying
Mr. Morgan's record, that he ought not to be prosecuted,
and refused to be party to it. As he was a man of domestic
habits, search was made in a nearby city where he had
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>relatives. He was easily traced. Mr. Morgan was both
proud and reticent, so the case worker made no attempt
to approach him, but told the woman she must devise
some way to get him back, preferably to write him and
say she was sorry. This she refused to do and on her
own responsibility adopted the clumsy device of wiring
him that a favorite child was sick. This brought him
&quot;on the run,&quot; and, being back, he stayed. <i>The case
worker has never seen Mr. M.</i>, nor has his wife been encouraged
to come any more to the office, although reports
have been received from time to time through the son
and daughter that things at home continue to go well.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center"><b>THE HOME-STAYING NON-SUPPORTER</b></p>


<p>Many of the case workers consulted in gathering
material for this book urged that a
discussion of the treatment of the non-supporter
who had not deserted be included in its pages.
In so far as non-support is a pre-desertion symptom
and the non-supporter a potential deserter,
much that has been said applies also to him.
But are the two groups co-terminous, or do they
only partially overlap?</p>

<p>The law makes little difference in its treatment
of the two, the fact of failure to support being
the chief ground of its interest.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Indeed, in
Massachusetts, the law under which deserters
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>are extradited for abandonment is habitually
spoken of as the &quot;non-support law.&quot;</p>

<p>No study of which the results are available
has been made to learn what difference, if any,
exists between the non-supporter who leaves
home and the one who does not. Miss Breed,
in making the point that the true analogy of the
deserted family is with the non-supported family
and not with the widow and her children, says:
&quot;The deserting husband is at home the non-supporting
husband.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>A case reader of experience writes: &quot;When I look
back over the many records I have read and studied, it
seems to me that it is very difficult to draw a line between
desertion and non-support cases, either in the kind of
problem they present, or in the treatment of them. Do
we know enough about non-supporters who later become
deserters; and isn't it possible that every non-support
case, certainly every beginning non-support case, is a
potential desertion case?&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>There is no doubt that the two groups grade
imperceptibly into each other; but of the twenty
or more case workers who were consulted in the
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>preparation of this material, nearly all felt that
the out-and-out deserter, if he can be got hold
of, is more promising material to work with
than the man who sits about the home and lets
others maintain it. They all recognize a common
middle ground where the two groups merge
into each other; but they see decided differences
in the two &quot;wings&quot; so to speak, outside of this
common ground.</p>

<p>Seen through their eyes, the non-supporter
has less courage, initiative and aggressiveness
than the deserter. &quot;He is less deliberately
cruel&mdash;for at least he 'sticks around.'&quot; He has
not the roving disposition, but is apt to be intemperate
and industrially inefficient as compared
with the deserter. Often the married
vagabond, as he has been called, is a &quot;home-loving
man who simply shirks responsibility and
dislikes effort.&quot; He may &quot;sometimes feel parental
responsibility even though he does not
support,&quot; and he is likely to have less physical
and mental stamina than the deserter. That
phrase in which the psychiatrists take refuge,
&quot;constitutional inferiority,&quot; is more likely to
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>describe the stay-at-home than the wanderer.
However, one social worker (non-medical) says
&quot;a mental twist more often enters into the problem
of the deserter than into that of the non-supporter,
from my experience.&quot;</p>

<p>The head of a large probation department
writes: &quot;Many of the deserters with whom we
have dealt were non-supporters before coming to
our attention. Among the men convicted of
abandonment, however, is a group which is
above the average in intelligence&mdash;skilled workers
or men in professional occupations.&quot;</p>

<p>If this concurrence of observation is sound
the reason for the social worker's preference for
the deserter as material with which to work is
not far to seek. With the deserter as described,
the problem is chiefly to alter his point of view;
with the non-supporter it is, in addition, to
stiffen his will and to increase his capacity&mdash;a
far more complicated task.</p>

<p>&quot;The deserter is likely to have less justification
than the non-supporter,&quot; says an observer of
long experience. Studies which have been made
of the relative capacity of the wives of deserters
<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>and of non-supporters seem to agree that the
latter have the weaker characters and are less
competent and successful workers. A comment
made upon one such study points out the impossibility
of sound conclusions, if both chronic
and incipient cases are included in the two
groups. The progressive demoralization in the
family of the &quot;intermittent husband&quot; makes
such a study of little value unless this distinction
is taken into account.</p>

<p>The influence of ill-kept homes in the manufacture
of non-supporting husbands has been
widely recognized.</p>

<blockquote><p>A drunkard's daughter, who had never known a decent
home, married a young man who soon began to
drink too. Luckily, the young couple were brought in
touch with a volunteer visitor who, on finding that the
wife possessed only two kitchen utensils, a teakettle and
a &quot;frypan,&quot; and actually did not know the names of any
others, undertook to give her lessons in home management.
She proved teachable, and her husband stopped
drinking and braced up. Some years later the visitor
was able to report a well established home, although the
family refused to move out of the poor neighborhood in
which they lived because the husband had been elected
councilman for that district.</p></blockquote>

<p><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>If the inefficient wife contributes her share to
this form of family breakdown so also does the
overefficient one. Many a non-supporter got
his first impulse in that direction when his wife
became a wage-earner in some domestic crisis.
&quot;There's only one rule for women who want to
have decent homes for their children and themselves,&quot;
advised a wise neighbor. &quot;If your husband
comes home crying, and says he can't find
any work, sit down on the other side of the fire
and cry until he <i>does</i>.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>One case worker comments on the relation
that often exists between an inefficient husband
and an unusually competent wife, made up of a
motherly toleration on her side and a tacit acceptance
on his that he is not expected to be
the provider. &quot;Sort of a landlady's husband&quot;
was the apt description of one such man, the
speaker having in mind the &quot;silent partner&quot;
who does odd jobs around his wife's furnished-room
house. The lovable old rascal portrayed
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>by Frank Bacon in his play &quot;Lightnin'&quot; is
typical of this kind of husband.</p>

<p>There is no ground for outside interference in
such an arrangement as long as both are satisfied
and the family as a unit is self-supporting.
It is often a serious problem to the case worker,
however, to know how to treat such a family
if the breadwinner-wife becomes incapacitated.
Such was the case when Mrs. Laflin fell ill with
tuberculosis. Her relatives described her husband
as &quot;that little nonentity of a man.&quot; He
had no bad habits and was pathetically eager to
work, but though only a little over fifty he was
prematurely aged and incapable. The solution
had finally to be institutional care for the entire
family, Mrs. Laflin in a hospital for incurables,
Mr. Laflin in a home for the aged, and their
two young daughters, through the interest of
a former employer, in a good convent school.
&quot;Uncomplicated&quot; non-support, as in the case
of Mr. Laflin, is, however, rare in the experience
of the social worker.</p>

<p>Out of a group of 51 non-supporters selected
at random from the records of the Buffalo<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>
Charity Organization Society in 1917, 46 showed
some serious moral fault other than non-support.
Alcoholism is probably the commonest of these
complications; and, as has been pointed out in
the previous chapter, is probably a primary cause
as well. It will be a matter of great interest to
social workers whether the &quot;non-support rate&quot;
is reduced after July 1, 1919. Grounds for hope
that it may be are found in the fact that some
remarkable results have been obtained by moving
alcoholic non-supporters and their families
from &quot;wet&quot; into &quot;dry&quot; territory.</p>

<p>Another vice that has a direct relation to non-support
(much more direct than to desertion) is
gambling. The gambler carries no signs of his
vice upon his person as does the inebriate, and
it is therefore hard to detect. It undoubtedly
does not appear in social case records as frequently
as it should. Case workers should have
it in mind as a possible explanation, whenever
there is a marked discrepancy between what a
non-supporter earns and what he contributes to
the home.</p>

<p>With the non-supporters rather than with the
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>deserters should be put the group of men whose
wives tire of supporting them and either put
them out or leave them. These men are often
not only morally, but mentally and physically,
so handicapped that there is nothing to be gained
by constantly pursuing and arresting them, although
some wives extract the sweets of revenge
from doing just this. Few courts of domestic
relations are without some wives as regular
patrons who pursue their husbands not for gain
but for sport. For the most part, however, the
wives of such men are philosophical. &quot;I only
wash for meself now,&quot; said one of them.</p>

<p>These men, and the unreclaimed deserters,
doubtless make up a large part of the floating
population of homeless men in our large cities.
How large a part it is impossible to say, for
they are likely to give assumed names and deny
the possession of families. Mrs. Solenberger<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
has noted, however, that if they are asked, not
&quot;Are you married?&quot; but a less direct question
such as &quot;Where is your wife now?&quot; a story of
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>unfortunate married life will often be elicited.
Until we have some better method of inter-city
registration of homeless men, many of these who
otherwise might be identified and in suitable
cases brought back, will continue to slip through
our fingers.</p>

<p>With non-support in an incipient stage,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> it is
sometimes possible to deal so suddenly and
effectively that the man is shocked into a better
realization of his responsibilities.</p>

<blockquote><p>A young Irish rigger, with a capable wife and two
pretty babies, lost his job after a quarrel with his boss
rigger. He was a genial, popular chap, always &quot;the life
of the party&quot; in his circle; and his companions encouraged
him to feel that he was a much injured man. They
also helped him to fill his enforced leisure with too much
beer. When the family received a dispossess notice the
wife's patience was at an end, and acting on the advice
of a society engaged in family case work, she put the
furniture in storage and went to a shelter where she
could leave her children in the daytime, while she was
at work, and have them with her at night. The man
was told to shift for himself until he could get together
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>sufficient money to re-establish the home. The arrangement
continued for nearly two months, during which the
man lived in lodging houses, had an attack of stomach
trouble, and was altogether thoroughly miserable. Every
night he waited for a word with his wife on a corner
that she had to pass in coming from work. Finally,
when it seemed to the social worker and to the wife that
his lesson had gone far enough, the home was re-established,
with only a small amount of help from the society.
During the five years since that time, no recurrence of
the trouble has come to the attention of the agency interested.</p></blockquote>

<p>This experiment was realized to be a ticklish
one, as a man less sincerely attached to his home
might have been turned into a vagabond by
such treatment.</p>

<p>In general, it may be said that, as there is
less to work on constructively with the non-supporter,
court action has more often to be
invoked. If the non-supporter is a &quot;chronic,&quot;
his path must not be allowed to be too easy.
&quot;Sometimes you just have to keep pestering him&quot;
was the way one social worker put it. A Red
Cross Home Service worker successfully shocked
one elderly non-supporter into going to work, as
described in one of the Red Cross publications:<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;Well, Mr. Gage,&quot; I said, &quot;I see you're not working
yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Mrs. Cox, the coal company promised to send
for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;I think you've been pretty fair with
that company. You've waited on it for three months
now. If I had the offer of another job I'd feel perfectly
free to take it, if I were you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;I think I should.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right, I have a job for you,&quot; said I. &quot;My husband
wants a man now at his garage, to clean automobiles.
The hours are from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., and you'll
earn $15 a week.&quot;</p>

<p>His paper fell from his hands to the floor; his jaw
dropped, and he just looked at me. Then he tried to
crawl out of it and began to make excuses.</p>

<p>&quot;I haven't time to argue with you, Mr. Gage,&quot; I said.
&quot;I'll keep the job open till seven o'clock tonight and
you can let me know then whether you'll take it or not.&quot;</p>

<p>At seven he came to say he'd take the job.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>If in desertion cases the interest centers very
vividly about the absent man, in non-support
cases the reverse is likely to be true, because he
is often not very interesting per se, and because,
moreover, he is always on the spot and does
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>not have to be searched for. Familiarity certainly
breeds contempt for the non-supporter.
Consequently the social worker may easily fall
into the danger of disregarding the human factors
he presents, and either treating the family as if
he did not exist or expending no further effort
on him than to see that he &quot;puts in&quot; six months
of every year in jail if possible (since the law
usually secures to him the privilege of loafing
the other six). It is not safe, however, to regard
even the most leisurely of non-supporters as
beyond the possibility of awakening. One district
secretary who had thus given a man up
had the experience of seeing him transformed
into a steady worker after a few months of intensive
effort by a first-year student in a school
of social science, whose only equipment for the
job was personality and enthusiasm. So remarkable
are some of the reclamations that have
been brought about with seemingly hopeless non-supporters
that all possible measures should be
tried before giving one of them up.</p>

<blockquote><p>His Scotch ancestry, a good wife, luck, and a friend
with insight and skill, pulled Aleck Gray out of that
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>bottomless pit, the gutter. Aleck had been a bookkeeper;
but he didn't get on well with his employers, lost his
job, got to drinking, and went so far downhill that his
wife had to take their two children and go home to her
people several hundred miles away. Aleck finally drifted
into a bureau for homeless men, where the agent became
interested in him and worked with him for six months,
getting him job after job, which he always lost through
drink or temper. He seemed incapable of taking directions
or working with other people. In all that time the
agent felt that he was getting no nearer the root of
Aleck's trouble, though he came back after each dismissal
and doggedly took whatever was offered. Finally, the
agent's patience wore thin, and when Aleck had been
more than usually dour and aggravating it went entirely
to pieces. Aleck listened to his outburst apparently unmoved;
then said, &quot;Very well, if you want to know what
would make me stop drinking, I'll tell you. If I could
see any ray of hope that I was on the way to getting my
home and family back, I'd stop and stop quick.&quot; On the
agent's desk there happened to be a letter from a friend
who wanted a tenant farmer. He thrust it into Aleck's
hand saying, &quot;There's your chance if you mean what
you say.&quot; The man's reply was to ask when he could
get a train. At the end of several weeks Aleck wrote
that he had not drunk a drop and was making good,
which was enthusiastically confirmed by his employer.
He begged the agent to intercede with his wife, and a
letter went to her which brought the telegraphic reply,
&quot;Starting tomorrow.&quot;<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></p>

<p>How they got through the first winter the agent never
knew exactly. But they pulled through and the next
year was easy, as country-born Aleck's skill came back.
Six years later, during which time the agent heard from
them once or twice a year, Aleck was still keeping
straight, the children were doing well in school, and the
family, prosperous and happy, had bought a farm of
their own in another state.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center"><b>NEXT STEPS IN CORRECTIVE TREATMENT</b></p>


<p>Any discussion of laws, their application,
and enforcement, must perforce be very
general, since the different states vary greatly in
laws governing desertion and in equipment for
their enforcement. Suggestions for a uniform
federal desertion law are not considered here;
the term &quot;next steps&quot; should be read as meaning
not plans in actual prospect but rather the
increase in legal facilities desirable from the
social worker's point of view. In communities
where no such facilities exist, social workers are
in a good position to collect illustrative material
and push for desirable changes in law and law
enforcement. Especially advantageous is the
position of the legal social agencies such as legal
aid societies and special bureaus and committees
for increasing the efficiency of the courts, many
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>of which are affiliated with or maintained by the
large family work societies.</p>


<p><b>1. Measures for the Discovery, Extradition or Deportation
of the Deserter.</b>&mdash;The nation-wide registration
of males between certain ages, under the
Selective Service Act, was widely utilized by
social workers in finding deserting men, with the
hearty co-operation usually of the draft boards.
This fact forms no argument for universal registration
as it was carried on in Germany before
the war; no system which meant such cumbersome
machinery or so much interference with
the freedom of the individual ought to be advocated
for a moment if it were solely for the purpose
of keeping track of the small percentage of
citizens who wish to evade their responsibilities,
marital and other. Even such a non-military
device as that which obligates every person to
register successive changes of address with the
postal authorities to facilitate delivery of mail
would be contrary to the American spirit and
easily evaded by people interested in concealing
their whereabouts, unless enforced with all the
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>rigor of the European police system. But
though we can advocate no system of manhood
registration, we can avail ourselves of the incidental
benefits of any that may be in force.</p>

<p>The Federal Employment Service offers a
promising means of help in discovering the movements
of deserters whose trade and probable
destination are known. It should be entirely
possible to work out a system by which the
managers of the local employment bureaus
should be furnished with name, description,
copy of photograph, and so on, of a deserter
who is being sought, so that the man if recognized
could be traced or quickly apprehended if
a warrant is already in the hands of the local
police authorities. It may even be possible,
under the federal employment service, to develop
the long wished for national registration of casual
and migratory labor. Need for some such system
has been felt by all agencies trying to deal constructively
with vagrants and homeless men.
Little track can be kept not only of the individual
wanderer but of the ebb and flow of the
tides of &quot;casual labor&quot; without some system of
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>this sort. If employment bureaus were required
to forward to a central registry the names and
some identifying particulars of every non-resident
who applied for employment, the problem
of finding the deserter would be rendered ten
times easier than it is now.</p>

<p>One present obstacle to this and other improvements
is the attitude of authorities&mdash;city,
state, and federal&mdash;toward wife desertion. We
have already mentioned the way in which the
task of tracing the deserter has been thrust
back upon the wife and the social worker, as if
he were not an offender against the community
as well as against his wife and children. Almost
as widespread is the reluctance of the proper
authorities to arrest the deserter and bring him
back after he has been found. A general atmosphere
of indifference and despair of accomplishing
anything worth while surrounds any attempt
to push the prosecution of a man who has taken
refuge outside the community. Hope for the
future lies in socializing the point of view of
court officials, police, and district attorneys&mdash;a
process in which the social worker must play a
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>large part. No chance should be lost to drive
home the social and economic waste involved,
by using the illustrative material which abounds
in the files of most case work agencies.</p>

<p>The pernicious system by which the wife is
required to serve summons and warrant upon
the offending husband who is still in the same
city, should be done away with entirely. The
social agency, public or private, which has had
to support or assist the man's family ought to
be able to prefer a charge for non-support, and
to take out a summons or a warrant and serve
it without the wife's being present. The agency
should in this case protect itself by securing
from the wife a signed affidavit and authorization
to act in her behalf. It may seem unimportant
whether the wife makes such complaint in the
court or to a private society. The psychological
effect upon the man is, however, very different.
If his wife initiates the complaint in court, his
resentment is directed toward her&mdash;a fact which
renders reconciliation more difficult if this is later
attempted. In other cases, for the wife to make
the complaint puts her in actual physical danger
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>from the vindictive husband. If he is brought
into court on the complaint of a social agency,
part of that resentment at least is transferred to
the intrusive social worker, who is not usually
seriously troubled thereby and is far better able
to bear the weight of the husband's displeasure
than is his poor wife.</p>

<p>The absence of any treaty with Great Britain
by which family deserters can be extradited to
or from Canada makes the Dominion a place of
refuge for many American evaders of family
responsibilities. The National Conference of
Charities and Correction,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> at its meeting in
Cleveland in 1912, passed a resolution on the
need for such a treaty. As a result, largely
through the efforts of Mr. William H. Baldwin,
the treaty was signed and sent to the Senate
for ratification in December, 1916. It was referred
to the Committee on Foreign Relations,
where it met with objection and has remained
without action up to the present. The National
Conference of Jewish Charities, at its meeting
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>in Kansas City in May, 1918, sent urgent representations
to the Senate Committee, which it is
hoped may result in ratification after the pressure
of war-time legislation is relaxed.</p>

<p>We should not stop when reciprocal extradition
with Canada has been secured; there is a
similar situation on our southern border in
states from which escape into Mexico is easy.
While American deserters are not likely to go
to other more remote countries than these two,
immigration into America from other countries
creates desertion problems in other places and
presents us with a class of undesirables with
whom it is difficult to deal under existing immigration
laws. In 1912 a report was submitted
to the Glasgow Parish Council showing the
alarming amount of dependency created in that
one city by the emigration to America and the
Colonies of men without their families, and who
subsequently drifted into the status of deserters.
This report makes the interesting suggestion
that no married man be permitted to emigrate
without his family unless he presents a &quot;written
sanction of the Parish Council or other local
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>authority,&quot; and further, that he be bound, under
penalty of deportation, to report himself to
some authority in the country of his destination,
which would satisfy itself as to his conduct and
insure that he did his duty by wife and family.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
Such a provision would of course involve the
revision of our own immigration laws, making
wife and family desertion a crime thereunder.</p>

<p>At present the law provides deportation only
within five years after entry, and for &quot;persons
who have been convicted of or admit having
committed a felony or other crime or misdemeanor
involving moral turpitude,&quot; or who are
sentenced to a term of one year or more in this
country, within five years of entry, for such
crime (or who may suffer a second conviction
at any time after entry). This would clearly
cover bigamy committed within five years after
entry; whether it could be stretched to cover
lesser forms of marital irresponsibility remains
to be determined. (It should be remembered
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>that a man who brings in as his wife, or later
sends for, a woman to whom he is not married,
can be deported under quite other sections of
the immigration law.)</p>

<p><b>2. Improvements in Court Procedure.</b>&mdash;A sore
point with the social worker is the often ridiculously
inadequate amounts that unwilling husbands
are put under court order to pay. They
accuse the courts, whether rightly or wrongly,
of considering first what part of the man's
alleged earnings will be needed for him to live
upon comfortably, and then of making the order
for whatever may be left over.</p>

<blockquote><p>Onofrio Mancini was under court order to stay away
from home and pay his wife $6.00 a week for the support
of their two children, He drove a two-horse truck, and,
at that time, must have been earning not less than $16.00
a week. Mrs. Mancini fell ill, whereupon Onofrio
promptly ceased all payments. The social agency interested
was permitted to make a complaint on producing
a doctors certificate that Mrs. Mancini could not
appear in court; but Onofrio, when he appeared, put up
such a hard luck tale of earning only $8.00 a week that
the judge, without investigation, cut the order down to
$4.00 a week and <i>ordered Onofrio to return home to live</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>A bulletin issued by the Seybert Institution
of Philadelphia gives a very interesting set of
diagrams showing the relation (or lack of relation)
between the amount of man's income, size
of family, and the court order issued in the
Philadelphia Municipal Court.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>This report gives a series of illustrations,
where glaring inconsistencies between the man's
earnings and the court order were observed by
visitors to the court. A sample of the reports
made by these visitors is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;Man earning $30 to $40 a week at ammunition factory.
Can earn $20 with no overtime. Has been sending
woman $10 a week but has threatened to leave town.
Judge said: 'You can't keep up $10 a week&mdash;how much
can you give?' Finally ordered $8 a week. Woman
said she couldn't live on that and Judge told her she
had to go to work herself then; that they should live
together anyway. Woman says she is unable to work&mdash;is
ill. When man stated he was giving $10 great consternation
seemed to take hold of the entire court force. He
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>did not say he couldn't pay $10; the judge simply told
him he couldn't keep that up.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>The practice of assigning less than half the
man's weekly earnings to the wife and children
has been defended on the ground that if he is
forced to live too economically, he will disappear
and the family will be left with nothing. This
would seem to be a self-confession on the part
of the court that it cannot enforce its reasonable
requirements. It would appear that the first
thing to be considered is the minimum needs of
the wife and children, taking into consideration
whether the wife can be expected to contribute
anything toward her own support or whether
all her time is needed for her children. This
amount should be cut down only when there
is actually not enough left for the man to live
on; and his wife and children should not be
pinched for necessities in order that he may
have luxuries or indulge in vices. The habit
some judges have of accepting the man's own
statement on oath as to what his earnings are
is responsible for many unjust orders. A man
who does not want to contribute to his family's
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>support is almost sure to understate his earnings,
oath or no oath; and the confirmation of
his employer (or when the employer is suspected
of being in league with him, the inspection of
the employer's books by the probation officer) is
often needed. Probably the most difficult form
of evasion to combat is that of the man who
deliberately takes a lower salary than he is
capable of earning, so as to have less to give
his wife. Surprising as it may seem, this is a
common practice; but skilful probation work
can nevertheless find a remedy.</p>

<p>In cases of suspended sentence, payments
ought always to be made through the court and
not handed by the man to his wife. It is better
to have the amount received and transmitted
by some bureau attached to the court, and so
managed that the man can send the money in
without &quot;knocking off work&quot; to bring it and
that the woman can receive it by mail. The
probation officer should not be bothered with
the actual handling of the money, but he should
be promptly notified of any delinquency in the
payments.</p>

<p><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>Whether the man under court order is on
probation or not, the cessation of payments
should automatically reopen the case. At present,
in most courts, the order goes by default
until the wife comes in to make another charge.
This, through discouragement or fear of a beating
from the man, she often neglects; with the
result that the orders of the court mean little
in the eyes of the men, and that arrears, once
allowed to mount up, are never cleared off.</p>

<p>This statement applies as well to long term
orders for separate support where the circumstances
are such that no reconciliation is contemplated.
These orders are now made for a
definite period of months, at the end of which
time the case drops unless the wife renews
charges. A case of this sort ought not to be
terminable without a reinvestigation and final
hearing in court. Indeed it would seem, in such
cases, that the children involved should have
at least as much protection as the children in
bastardy proceedings, and that the order should
be made to cover the term of years until the
oldest child becomes of working age.</p>

<p><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>The most important step in advance with
regard to payments is undoubtedly the law
which has been tried with signal success in the
District of Columbia and in the states of Ohio
and Massachusetts, requiring men serving prison
sentences for non-support and abandonment to
be made to work, and a sum of money, representing
their earnings, to be turned over to their
families.</p>

<p>In an interesting paper in the <i>Survey</i> for
November 20, 1909, entitled &quot;Making the Deserter
Pay the Piper,&quot; Mr. William H. Baldwin
discusses in detail how this plan was made to
work successfully in the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>The movement for special courts to consider
cases of juvenile delinquency and marital relations
has gained such headway that no word
needs to be said here in its favor. In communities
where the volume of court business permits
such courts to be separately organized, they are
generally accepted as the only means of handling
these matters. In smaller communities the need
may be met by setting aside regular sessions of
the magistrates' courts for this purpose.</p>

<p><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>Juvenile courts and domestic relations courts
having proved a success separately, there is a
strong movement on foot to combine them into
one court, for which the name Family Court has
been proposed.</p>

<p>A leader in this movement is Judge Hoffman
of the Family Court of Cincinnati, which he
describes thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;The Court of Cincinnati was organized for the purpose
of dealing with the family as a unit and to ascertain
possibly the cause of its disruption. It has exclusive
jurisdiction in all divorce and alimony cases, and all
matters coming under the Juvenile Court Act. It also
has jurisdiction in cases of failure to provide. The ideal
court would include in connection with the foregoing
functions, adoption of children, the issuing of marriage
licenses, and bastardy cases.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>One advantage of this plan is the economy
it effects in the time of probation officers. It is
generally admitted that in children's court cases
it is the parents rather than the children who
are really on probation; and with two courts
and two separate probation systems, we may
<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>even have the anomaly of the same family being
under the care of two probation officers at once.
Specialization can no further go! Other leaders
in the domestic relations court movement see
little merit in the proposal for a one-part family
court. They think that, in the large cities at
least, the need would be better served by having
the domestic relations and juvenile courts under
one roof, but as two separate and distinct parts
of the same court. All are agreed, however,
that the powers of one or the other of the two
special courts should be enlarged to cover bastardy
cases, where this is not now done.</p>

<p>The domestic relations court, whether separate
or as part of a family court, ought to have
equity powers, so that the usual rules of evidence
need not be so closely adhered to and
more latitude could be allowed the magistrate
in disposing of cases, not necessarily according
to ruling and precedent but according to the
social needs disclosed. A constitutional amendment
now pending in New York is a model for
this sort of legislation. It is in part as follows:<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;The legislature may establish children's courts and
courts of domestic relations as separate courts or parts of
existing courts, or courts hereafter to be created, and
may confer upon them such equity and other jurisdiction
as may be necessary for the correction, protection, guardianship
and disposition of delinquent, neglected or dependent
minors, and for the punishment and correction
of adults responsible for or contributing to such delinquency,
neglect or dependency, and to compel the support
of a wife, child or poor relative by persons legally
chargeable therewith who abandon or neglect to support
any of them.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Many courts of domestic relations which now
exercise equity powers, such as ordering that a
man remain away from home or that a wife
allow her husband to see his children at stated
times, do so without actual legal warrant and
subject at any time to appeal of counsel. The
conferring of equity powers on courts of domestic
relations is a form of protection both to the
court and to its clients which social workers
should stand ready to work for.</p>

<p>Juvenile courts have in the main outstripped
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>the domestic relations courts in the use of physicians
and psychiatrists. The best examples of
both these courts have, however, facilities for
the making of physical examinations and mental
tests, where necessary, before adjudication.
Judge Hoffman says that the fact that so many
cases in courts of domestic relations disclose abnormal
or perverted sex habits, makes important
the services of a psychiatrist accustomed to
diagnosing these conditions.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>In most states the jurisdiction of the courts
of domestic relations should be extended and
co-ordinated. Few states escape some glaring
inconsistencies in the laws governing desertion
and abandonment. There is, for instance, much
confusion between states as to whether a woman
whose husband brings her to a strange city and
there deserts her must prosecute him in the city
where their home is or where the desertion took
place. Under certain circumstances the woman
is forced to travel to the city where her husband
has gone, and bring action against him there,
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>if the courts in that place will entertain a suit.
In New York state there is no law which covers
the case of a man who abandons his wife while
she is pregnant, if there is no other living child.
To constitute an extraditable crime there must
have been abandonment of a child <i>in esse</i> not
merely <i>in posse</i>.</p>

<p>But no institution, however carefully established
by law, is any more effective than the
people who run it; and the usefulness of the
domestic relations court in any community depends
entirely upon the social-mindedness and
freedom from political entanglement of the
judge and the amount and quality of probation
service. From a social point of view, the latter
is more important than the former; for a bad
decision of the court can be mitigated by good
case work later on, while a poor probation
officer may nullify the effects of the wisest
judicial decision ever made.</p>

<p>The importance of having enough probation
officers to handle the work of the court has
already been touched upon. An overworked
officer is perforce an inefficient officer. He has
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>usually to spend at least half his time in the
court and attending to the clerical end of his
job. From 50 to 60 cases is probably all that
one probation officer can be expected to handle
thoroughly at one time, if, as is to be hoped,
he is required to make careful preliminary investigations
to be presented to the judge <i>before</i>
the trial.</p>

<p>In training and in equipment for the job, probation
officers should be the equals of case workers
in private agencies. Examinations for probation
officers ought to be conducted by social
workers of skill and high standards. A few
months of cramming at a civil service school, or
a few weeks of volunteer visiting with some case
working agency, should not suffice to enable
candidates to pass the examinations. The standards
should be high enough and the salaries
sufficiently attractive to draw into this field
people who have successfully completed their
apprenticeship in the art of case work. Only
then can the status of the probation officer be
raised to what it should be in the court itself.
The relation of the probation officer to the judge
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>ought to be exactly like the relation of the medical
social worker to the physician&mdash;that of a
person acting under his direction in a general
way, but with a special contribution to make to
the treatment of the case and with a recognized
standing as an expert in his own particular field.</p>

<p class="center"><b>NEXT STEPS IN PREVENTIVE TREATMENT</b></p>


<p>At this time of writing it is too soon after
the signing of the armistice to make predictions
as to what the Great War may do to marriage.
Whether desertion and divorce will increase
or decrease it is impossible to say, and
the experience of Europe is beside the mark.
The war will leave traces on this generation&mdash;no
doubt about that; but our losses have not
been heavy enough seriously to disturb the balance
of the sexes. The war, which has been
to the common people of our country a war of
service and ideals, has erased much that was
petty and selfish; it has also caused nervous
shocks and strains incalculable and unimagined.
Years from now we may be able to strike the
balance, but today this cannot be done. It is
impossible also to say whether the growing
<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>irresponsibility that was generally recognized to
be threatening married life in the years before
the war is still operating with like effect, or
whether the full tide of emotion in which the
world has been lately submerged may have swept
at least a part of it away.</p>

<p>We are dealing here, however, not so much
with modifications in the spirit of the times, as
with prevention in the individual case.</p>

<p>One very fundamental claim can be made
concerning marital shipwrecks; namely, that
the way to prevent many of them would have
been to see that the marriage never was allowed
to take place. Marriage laws and their enforcement
form a whole subject in themselves which
is now receiving careful study, the results of
which should be available shortly.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> This fact
precludes any discussion of the subject here,
though the relation of our marriage laws to
marital discord is so obvious that some mention
of the matter is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>It was formerly the belief of students of
family desertion that the best way to prevent
desertions was to punish them quickly and
severely. It should be said that this plan has
never received a fair trial on a large scale, for
legal equipment has always lagged behind knowledge.
It may be true that just as a community
can, within limits, regulate its death rate by
what it is willing to pay, so it can by repressive
measures regulate its desertion rate. But measures
that keep the would-be deserter in the home
which constantly grows less of a home, simply
through fear of consequences if he left it, seem
hardly a desirable form of prevention from the
social point of view. It would be much better
to catch the disintegrating family in whatever
form of social drag-net could be devised, and
deal with it individually and constructively
along the lines which case work has laid down.</p>

<p>Is it possible, however, to recognize a &quot;pre-desertion
state?&quot; And if so, what are the danger
signals? One case worker answers this question
sententiously: &quot;Any influences which tend
to destroy family solidarity are possible signs of
<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>desertion.&quot; Another writes: &quot;We have sometimes
found it possible to recognize a 'pre-desertion
state' in the intermittent deserter, where
we know the conditions which previously led to
desertion, but I doubt whether we have very
often been able to note it in the case of first
desertions. In general, I should say a growing
carelessness or a growing despondency as to his
ability to care for his family are danger signals
in the man, of which it is well to keep track.&quot;</p>

<p>The conditions listed in Chapter II as &quot;contributory
factors&quot; might in certain combinations
be decided danger signals of impending desertion.
Non-support itself is, indeed, one of the
most common of such signals, though a man
who has dealt with hundreds of desertion cases
maintained recently that the best and most
hopeful type of deserter is the one who supports
his family adequately up to the time of leaving
home.</p>

<p>In the following case the items that led the
case worker to suspect an approaching desertion
are set down in the order stated by her. The
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>couple were Irish; the man had never deserted
before.</p>

<blockquote><p>(1) He had spoken with eagerness of the wages that
were being earned in munition plants in a city a few
hours away&mdash;said he would like to go to some of those
munition places and see what he could make.</p>

<p>(2) He was an intermittent drinker.</p>

<p>(3) His work record was poor; employers said he was
irregular and unreliable.</p>

<p>(4) Visitor felt he had never earned as much as he
was easily capable of earning and was rather indifferent
to the needs of his family.</p>

<p>(5) The woman was willing to work&mdash;had applied for
day nursery care, but visitor had persuaded the nursery
not to accept the children.</p></blockquote>

<p>After the visitor had stated the first two of
the above items she stopped, and did not add
the more significant three that followed until
reminded that many workmen who drank intermittently
were at that time thinking enviously
of munition factory wages; and that these
hardly constituted danger signals. The cumulative
effect of all five items cannot, however, be
denied.</p>

<p>Another statement, similarly obtained, con<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>cerns
a colored couple, married about two years
and with two children, the youngest less than a
month old. Man had been out of work and
family had gone to live with relatives.</p>

<blockquote><p>(1) Man earns $20 a week but refuses to start housekeeping
again, although they are seriously overcrowded&mdash;seven
adults and five children in five rooms.</p>

<p>(2) Woman says he makes her sleep on chairs so that
he can get better rest.</p>

<p>(3) He is seeing a good deal of another woman, a
friend of the wife (wife's statement only).</p>

<p>(4) Woman had applied for nursery care for both children
so that she might go to work.</p>

<p>(5) It transpires that she lived with him before marriage,
and that the first child was a month old when the
marriage took place. He &quot;holds it over her.&quot;</p>

<p>(6) Man had been married before and divorced.</p>

<p>(7) The family's habits of recreation are changed;
the man no longer &quot;takes her out.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>Such attempts to foretell the future are not
infallible, of course; but a listing process is a
valuable aid to diagnosis, and, by its help, a
situation may be uncovered which tends toward
complete family breakdown. This may be taken
in time and prevented; or, if separation is inevitable
it can be prepared for in advance, the
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>necessary legal arrangements can be made to
protect the family, and the anxiety, suspense,
and useless effort avoided which a sudden and
downright abandonment would cause.</p>

<p>But the trouble is that the problem seldom
comes to the case worker until matters have
progressed farther than this. The real question
is&mdash;not how to recognize pre-desertion symptoms,
but how to get hold of families when
these symptoms are in the incipient stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Hiram Myers, manager of the Desertion
Bureau of the New York Association for Improving
the Condition of the Poor, who has
made a close study of the subject, holds the
theory that the real period of stress in marital
adjustment comes not during the &quot;critical first
year,&quot; about which we have been told so much,
but at a later period, which he sets roughly at
from the third to the fifth year after marriage.
By this time there are usually one or two babies,
the wife's girlish charm has gone, and the romance
of the first attraction has vanished, while
the steady force of conjugal affection which
should smooth their path through the years
<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>ahead has not come to take its place. It is in
this middle period that longings for the delights
of his care-free youth begin to come back to a
man; if he ever had the wandering foot, it begins
again to twitch for the road; of else his
fancy is captured by some other girl not tied
down at home by children. It is at this time,
too, that endless discords and misunderstandings
arise&mdash;that the last bit of gilt crumbles off
the gingerbread.</p>

<p>As a result of his observations, Mr. Myers
feels sure that the majority of first desertions
take place somewhere from the third to the fifth
year after marriage. Miss Brandt's<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> careful
statistical study of 574 deserted families shows
that in nearly 46 per cent of the families the
first desertion took place before the fifth year
of married life. Of course the jars that may
come in the earlier months of marriage are seldom
brought to the attention of social agencies,
as it is usually the presence of children in the
family and the consequent burden upon the
<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>wife which make such agencies acquainted with
her.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that further study will be
made upon these points. It is well known and
accepted that the majority of first deserters are
young men; but if certain danger periods in
married life can be definitely recognized, many
new possibilities in prevention and treatment
will be opened up.</p>

<p>A number of experiments and suggestions
have lately been made which may prove to be
the means of recognizing marital troubles early.
The probation department of the Chicago Court
of Domestic Relations some years ago established
a consultation bureau to which people might
come or be sent for advice on difficult matrimonial
situations, and without any court record
being made. The Department of Public Charities
of New York City maintains a similar bureau
which is, however, so closely connected with the
court that its clients make little distinction between
them.</p>

<p>In addition to such conscious efforts to reach
out after marital tangles in the pre-court stage,
<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>there has recently been an interesting though
accidental development in the city of Cleveland.
During the thrift campaign of 1918, several savings
banks of that city conceived the idea that
their depositors could be induced and helped to
save more money if the banks opened a bureau
for free advice to their patrons on household
management. This bureau is still in the experimental
stage but it has had an increasing clientele
so far. One thing that has astonished its management&mdash;but
which causes no surprise in the
mind of a social worker&mdash;has been the great
variety of problems other than those connected
with the family budget that have come to light
in the bureau's consultations. Particularly is
this true of marital discord centering about
money affairs.</p>

<p>If such bureaus prove their usefulness there
is no reason why they might not be greatly extended,
and why other agencies than banks (insurance
companies, for example) might not be
eager thus to serve their customers. This opens
a new field for the home economist, but incidentally
it would appear that, in order to func<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>tion
successfully, such bureaus would need to
have access to the services of agencies employing
highly skilled social case workers. It is conceivable
that, if there are developed in our large
cities consultation facilities under social auspices
for people who feel their marriages going wrong,
and want help and advice in righting them, such
bureaus as those described above would be excellent
&quot;feeders&quot; for this new form of social service.</p>

<p>Family social agencies have been distinctly
backward in some of their approaches to the
fundamental problems of family life. The failure
of most of them, for instance, to study or seek
improvements in the laws governing marriage
or in their administration, is difficult of explanation.
Such a consultation service as that suggested
does, however, indicate a new point of
departure in dealing with marital relations
which would seem to fall distinctly within the
field of the family case work agencies. It is
time that these agencies began to find means
of dealing, not with the dependent family alone
but with the family in danger of becoming dependent&mdash;not
with the family broken and
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>estranged only, but with the one whose bonds,
even if cracking and ill-adjusted, still hold.</p>

<p>Concretely, why should not family agencies
establish such consultation bureaus as have
just been mentioned, distinct from their regular
activities and hampered by no suggestion in
their title of association with problems of dependency?
Dr. William Healy of Boston ascribes
much of his success in getting the parents of
defective and backward children to bring them
voluntarily for examination to the fact that the
name of his organization (the Judge Baker
Foundation) conveys no hint of stigma or inferiority.
Here is a valuable lesson in right
publicity.</p>

<p>A bureau of family advice such as has been suggested
should be under unimpeachable auspices
from the point of view of medicine and psychiatry;
it should have the services not only of
expert social workers and experts in household
management, but of doctors and psychiatrists
as well. If it could be run as a joint-stock enterprise,
in which courts and social agencies might
be equally interested, so much the better. Its
<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>investigations should be searching enough to
discourage applications from curiosity-mongers;
but its services, like those of any clinic, should
be given for whatever the patient is able to pay.
Its relations, needless to say, should be entirely
confidential, and as privileged in the eyes of the
law as are those of doctor, lawyer, and priest.</p>

<p>It may be objected that people guard their
marital infelicities too jealously and are too
loath to discuss them to come willingly to such
a place; that the idea involves a presumptuous
interference in the private lives of individuals.
But neurologists know that people in increasing
numbers feel the need, under conditions of modern
stress, for a safe outlet and a chance to discuss
their perplexities and find counsel.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago the interest now taken by the
social and medical professions in the question
of whether mothers are rearing their infants
properly could not have been foreseen. The
establishment of baby health stations, or the
activities of the Children's Bureau, would have
been looked upon as unwarranted interference
between the child and its mother, whose natural
<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>instincts could be depended upon to teach her
how to nourish it. This point of view is no
longer held; and the community's duty to take
an interest in the upbringing of its children is
never questioned. Is it not conceivable that,
before another half century has rolled around,
the community may take the same intelligent
interest in the conservation of the family, and
that definite efforts, which are now almost
entirely lacking, may be made to stabilize and
protect it?</p>

<p>Educational propaganda would, of course,
have to be a definite part of the work of such
bureaus. By this is meant not such modern
specialties as &quot;birth control,&quot; &quot;sex hygiene,&quot;
<i>et al.</i>, though we may by that time have enough
authoritative information about sex psychology
in marriage to be able to afford some help along
these lines. Instruction in the <i>ethics</i> of married
life and parenthood is of even more fundamental
importance. The prevailing cynicism, the present
low concepts of marriage, should be vigorously
combatted by such an organization. Religious
instruction would be, of course, beyond its
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>scope; but it should be able to work sympathetically
with all creeds, supplementing their teachings
without seeking to duplicate them.</p>

<p>The services of such a bureau could not, of
course, be forced upon anyone who did not wish
to avail himself or herself of them; but definite
though tactful efforts could be made to reach
all young couples (just as are now being made
to reach young mothers) with information as to
where advice could be obtained.</p>

<p>No trustworthy figures exist as to the number
of families broken by desertion or divorce in the
United States, or as to the burden of actual dependency
caused. Courts, probation officers,
psychiatrists, and family case workers are all
dissatisfied with our efforts to patch up the
families which are already disintegrating. One
of the three groups mentioned is likely before
long to attempt some more dynamic attack
upon the problem in its inception. If any suggestions
herein contained find use in that program,
the labor of compiling them will have
been indeed well spent.</p>

<h2>SOCIAL WORK SERIES</h2>

<h3>EDITED BY MARY E. RICHMOND</h3>

<div style="margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">
<p>Many people have general views in these days
upon almost any matter which affects social
welfare; we all know how easily such views find
expression. On the other hand, only a few have
the patience and the insight to gather the specific
facts and find out what they mean. Still fewer&mdash;having
done so much as this&mdash;can explain the
meaning lucidly and in brief compass.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
